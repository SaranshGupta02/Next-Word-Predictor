It comes from your own actions.\\nCount your age by friends, not years. Count your life by smiles, not tears.\\nPromise Yourself\\nIf more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.\\nAttitude is a choice. Happiness is a choice.

It is what you think about it.\\nNo medicine cures what happiness cannot.\\nDonâ\\x80\\x99t waste your time in anger, regrets, worries, and grudges. Life is too short to be unhappy.\\nHappiness is having a large, loving, caring, close-knit family in another city.\\nEven if you cannot change all the people around you, you can change the people you choose to be around. Life is too short to waste your time on people who donâ\\x80\\x99t respect, appreciate, and value you. Spend your life with people who make you smile, laugh, and feel loved.\\nLet us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom.\\nIf you want to be happy, do not dwell in the past, do not worry about the future, focus on living fully in the present.\\nThe only way to find true happiness is to risk being completely cut open.\\nHope\\nOf all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness.\\nI felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of sceneryâ\\x80\\x94air, mountains, trees, people.

You fight for it, strive for it, insist upon it, and sometimes even travel around the world looking for it. You have to participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings. And once you have achieved a state of happiness, you must never become lax about maintaining it. You must make a mighty effort to keep swimming upward into that happiness forever, to stay afloat on top of it.\\nLetting go means to come to the realization that some people are a part of your history, but not a part of your destiny.\\nSuccess is getting what you want, happiness is wanting what you get\\nHappiness [is] only real when shared\\nIt\\'s been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your mind firmly that you will.\\nI\\'ve got nothing to do today but smile.\\nAlways find opportunities to make someone smile, and to offer random acts of kindness in everyday life.\\nThe worst part of success is trying to find someone who is happy for you.\\nIt\\'s like Tolstoy said.

Be the living expression of God\\'s kindness: kindness in your face, kindness in your eyes, kindness in your smile.\\nI think and think and think, Iâ\\x80\\x98ve thought myself out of happiness one million times, but never once into it.\\nSo we shall let the reader answer this question for himself: who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?\\nHappiness is not the absence of problems, it\\'s the ability to deal with them.\\nThe grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.\\nDon\\'t aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one\\'s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one\\'s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-runâ\\x80\\x94in the long-run, I say!â\\x80\\x94success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it\\nI\\'d far rather be happy than right any day.\\nIt was only a sunny smile, and little it cost in the giving, but like morning light it scattered the night and made the day worth living.\\nAnd hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,\\nHappiness quite unshared can scarcely be called happiness; it has no taste.\\nThe more you feed your mind with positive thoughts, the more you can attract great things into your life.\\nOne of the keys to happiness is a bad memory.\\nI felt once more how simple and frugal a thing is happiness: a glass of wine, a roast chestnut, a wretched little brazier, the sound of the sea. Nothing else.\\nHappiness depends on your mindset and attitude.\\nI know that\\'s what people say-- you\\'ll get over it. I\\'d say it, too. But I know it\\'s not true. Oh, youll be happy again, never fear. But you won\\'t forget. Every time you fall in love it will be because something in the man reminds you of him.\\nHappiness depends upon ourselves.\\nActual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the overcompensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn\\'t nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand.\\nSometimes life knocks you on your ass... get up, get up, get up!!! Happiness is not the absence of problems, it\\'s the ability to deal with them.\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t know whatâ\\x80\\x99s worse: to not know what you are and be happy, or to become what youâ\\x80\\x99ve always wanted to be, and feel alone.\\nI do not miss childhood, but I miss the way I took pleasure in small things, even as greater things crumbled. I could not control the world I was in, could not walk away from things or people or moments that hurt, but I took joy in the things that made me happy.\\nTrue happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing. The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not.\\nNow and then it\\'s good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy.\\nPeople like to say love is unconditional, but it\\'s not, and even if it was unconditional, it\\'s still never free. There\\'s always an expectation attached. They always want something in return. Like they want you to be happy or whatever and that makes you automatically responsible for their happiness because they won\\'t be happy unless you are ... I just don\\'t want that responsibility.\\nI am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.\\nPart of the problem with the word \\'disabilities\\' is that it immediately suggests an inability to see or hear or walk or do other things that many of us take for granted. But what of people who can\\'t feel? Or talk about their feelings? Or manage their feelings in constructive ways? What of people who aren\\'t able to form close and strong relationships? And people who cannot find fulfillment in their lives, or those who have lost hope, who live in disappointment and bitterness and find in life no joy, no love? These, it seems to me, are the real disabilities.\\nHappiness makes up in height for what it lacks in length.\\nWhat, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: \\'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more\\' ... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: \\'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.\\nA quiet secluded life in the country, with the possibility of being useful to people to whom it is easy to do good, and who are not accustomed to have it done to them; then work which one hopes may be of some use; then rest, nature, books, music, love for one\\'s neighbor â\\x80\\x94 such is my idea of happiness.\\nWith mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come.\\nThere is some kind of a sweet innocence in being human- in not having to be just happy or just sad- in the nature of being able to be both broken and whole, at the same time.\\nGenerally speaking, the most miserable people I know are those who are obsessed with themselves; the happiest people I know are those who lose themselves in the service of others...By and large, I have come to see that if we complain about life, it is because we are thinking only of ourselves.\\nThere is nothing more rare, nor more beautiful, than a woman being unapologetically herself; comfortable in her perfect imperfection. To me, that is the true essence of beauty.\\nHappiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence.\\nEster asked why people are sad.\\nHappily ever after, or even just together ever after, is not cheesy, Wren said. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the noblest, like, the most courageous thing two people can shoot for.\\nSmile more. Smiling can make you and others happy.\\nThe problem with people is they forget that most of the time it\\'s the small things that count.\\nMaybe the truth is, there\\'s a little bit of loser in all of us. Being happy isn\\'t having everything in your life be perfect. Maybe it\\'s about stringing together all the little things.\\nWe donâ\\x80\\x99t even ask happiness, just a little less pain.\\nThere are two ways to get enough. One is to continue to accumulate more and more. The other is to desire less.\\nThose who are not looking for happiness are the most likely to find it, because those who are searching forget that the surest way to be happy is to seek happiness for others.\\nSadness gives depth. Happiness gives height. Sadness gives roots. Happiness gives branches. Happiness is like a tree going into the sky, and sadness is like the roots going down into the womb of the earth. Both are needed, and the higher a tree goes, the deeper it goes, simultaneously. The bigger the tree, the bigger will be its roots. In fact, it is always in proportion. That\\'s its balance.\\nHappiness is an accident of nature, a beautiful and flawless aberration.\\nStop giving other people the power to control your happiness, your mind, and your life. If you don\\'t take control of yourself and your own life, someone else is bound to try.\\nThis planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movement of small green pieces of paper, which was odd because on the whole it wasn\\'t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.\\nWhoever is happy will make others happy.\\nYouâ\\x80\\x99ll learn, as you get older, that rules are made to be broken. Be bold enough to live life on your terms, and never, ever apologize for it. Go against the grain, refuse to conform, take the road less traveled instead of the well-beaten path. Laugh in the face of adversity, and leap before you look. Dance as though EVERYBODY is watching. March to the beat of your own drummer. And stubbornly refuse to fit in.\\nThe secret of happiness is freedom, the secret of freedom is courage.\\nI\\'m choosing happiness over suffering, I know I am. I\\'m making space for the unknown future to fill up my life with yet-to-come surprises.\\nLaughter is poison to fear.\\nI have a million things to talk to you about. All I want in this world is you. I want to see you and talk. I want the two of us to begin everything from the beginning.\\nKeep your best wishes, close to your heart and watch what happens\\nIt is the very mark of the spirit of rebellion to crave for happiness in this life\\nI will not try to convince you to love me, to respect me, to commit to me. I deserve better than that; I AM BETTER THAN THAT...Goodbye.\\nHappiness is not a possession to be prized, it is a quality of thought, a state of mind.\\nAfter all, what is happiness? Love, they tell me. But love doesn\\'t bring and never has brought happiness. On the contrary, it\\'s a constant state of anxiety, a battlefield; it\\'s sleepless nights, asking ourselves all the time if we\\'re doing the right thing. Real love is composed of ecstasy and agony.\\nLetting go gives us freedom, and freedom is the only condition for happiness. If, in our heart, we still cling to anything - anger, anxiety, or possessions - we cannot be free.\\nA mathematical formula for happiness:Reality divided by Expectations.There were two ways to be happy:improve your reality or lower your expectations.\\nA smile puts you on the right track. A smile makes the world a beautiful place. When you lose your smile, you lose your way in the chaos of life.\\nI think happiness is what makes you pretty. Period. Happy people are beautiful. They become like a mirror and they reflect that happiness.\\nI have no faith in human perfectibility. I think that human exertion will have no appreciable effect upon humanity. Man is now only more active - not more happy - nor more wise, than he was 6000 years ago.\\nHappiness is not a goal...it\\'s a by-product of a life well lived.\\nAction may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action. \\nDonâ\\x80\\x99t sacrifice yourself too much, because if you sacrifice too much thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing else you can give and nobody will care for you.\\nPerfectionism is the enemy of happiness. Embrace being perfectly imperfect. Learn from your mistakes and forgive yourself, youâ\\x80\\x99ll be happier. We make mistakes because we are imperfect. Learn from your mistakes, forgive yourself, and keep moving forward.\\nI, not events, have the power to make me happy or unhappy today. I can choose which it shall be. Yesterday is dead, tomorrow hasn\\'t arrived yet. I have just one day, today, and I\\'m going to be happy in it.\\nYou are in charge of your own happiness; you don\\'t need to wait for other people\\'s permission to be happy.\\nPeople are unhappy when they get something too easily. You have to sweat--that\\'s the only moral they know.\\nChildren are happy because they don\\'t have a file in their minds called \"All the Things That Could Go Wrong.\\nThe trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. This is the treason of the artist; a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain.\\nWith all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,\\nThe power of finding beauty in the humblest things makes home happy and life lovely.\\nWealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.\\nI find the best way to love someone is not to change them, but instead, help them reveal the greatest version of themselves.\\nVery little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself in your way of thinking.\\nIt does not matter how long you are spending on the earth, how much money you have gathered or how much attention you have received. It is the amount of positive vibration you have radiated in life that matters,\\nAnd I can\\'t be running back and fourth forever between grief and high delight.\\nAh, what happiness it is to be with people who are all happy, to press hands, press cheeks, smile into eyes.\\nA thing of beauty is a joy forever.\\nThere is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.\\nThe greater part of our happiness or misery depends upon our dispositions, and not upon our circumstances.\\nLet us dance in the sun, wearing wild flowers in our hair...\\nThe pain I feel now is the happiness I had before. That\\'s the deal.\\nWhat can I do with my happiness? How can I keep it, conceal it, bury it where I may never lose it? I want to kneel as it falls over me like rain, gather it up with lace and silk, and press it over myself again.\\nI had rather hear my dog bark at a crow, than a man swear he loves me.\\nI heard a definition once: Happiness is health and a short memory! I wish I\\'d invented it, because it is very true.\\nEveryone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happiness and growth occurs while you\\'re climbing it.\\nI am a happy camper so I guess Iâ\\x80\\x99m doing something right. Happiness is like a butterfly; the more you chase it, the more it will elude you, but if you turn your attention to other things, it will come and sit softly on your shoulder.\\nThat\\'s the difference between me and the rest of the world! Happiness isn\\'t good enough for me! I demand euphoria!\\nThe sense of unhappiness is so much easier to convey than that of happiness. In misery we seem aware of our own existence, even though it may be in the form of a monstrous egotism: this pain of mine is individual, this nerve that winces belongs to me and to no other. But happiness annihilates us: we lose our identity.\\nIt is an illusion that youth is happy, an illusion of those who have lost it; but the young know they are wretched for they are full of the truthless ideal which have been instilled into them, and each time they come in contact with the real, they are bruised and wounded. It looks as if they were victims of a conspiracy; for the books they read, ideal by the necessity of selection, and the conversation of their elders, who look back upon the past through a rosy haze of forgetfulness, prepare them for an unreal life. They must discover for themselves that all they have read and all they have been told are lies, lies, lies; and each discovery is another nail driven into the body on the cross of life.\\nHappiness consists in frequent repetition of pleasure\\nI am very happy\\nI don\\'t think that there are any limits to how excellent we could make life seem.\\nThis life is yours. Take the power to choose what you want to do and do it well. Take the power to love what you want in life and love it honestly. Take the power to walk in the forest and be a part of nature. Take the power to control your own life. No one else can do it for you. Take the power to make your life happy.\\nI\\'m a kind of paranoiac in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy.\\nIf only we\\'d stop trying to be happy, we could have a pretty good time.\\nIt takes three to make love, not two: you, your spouse, and God. Without God people only succeed in bringing out the worst in one another. Lovers who have nothing else to do but love each other soon find there is nothing else. Without a central loyalty life is unfinished.\\nIf you don\\'t want a man unhappy politically, don\\'t give him two sides to a question to worry him; give him one. Better yet, give him none. Let him forget there is such a thing as war. If the government is inefficient, top-heavy, and tax-mad, better it be all those than that people worry over it. Peace, Montag. Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year. Cram them full of noncombustible data, chock them so damned full of \\'facts\\' they feel stuffed, but absolutely \\'brilliant\\' with information. Then they\\'ll feel they\\'re thinking, they\\'ll get a sense of motion without moving. And they\\'ll be happy, because facts of that sort don\\'t change.\\nI\\'ve always thought people would find a lot more pleasure in their routines if they burst into song at significant moments.\\nAnd therein lies the whole of man\\'s plight. Human time does not turn in a circle; it runs ahead in a straight line. That is why man cannot be happy: happiness is the longing for repetition.\\nHappiness. It was the place where passion, with all its dazzle and drumbeat, met something softer: homecoming and safety and pure sunbeam comfort. It was all those things, intertwined with the heat and the thrill, and it was as bright within her as a swallowed star.\\nIf you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion.\\nNo one should ever ask themselves that: why am I unhappy? The question carries within it the virus that will destroy everything. If we ask that question, it means we want to find out what makes us happy. If what makes us happy is different from what we have now, then we must either change once and for all or stay as we are, feeling even more unhappy.\\nThe only time you fail is when you fall down and stay down.\\nEven if things don\\'t unfold the way you expected, don\\'t be disheartened or give up. One who continues to advance will win in the end.\\nLife is not a PG feel-good movie. Real life often ends badly. Literature tries to document this reality, while showing us it is still possible for us to endure nobly.\\nThe more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate.\\nMy happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end. It is its own goal. It is its own purpose.\\nHappiness is a risk. If youâ\\x80\\x99re not a little scared, then youâ\\x80\\x99re not doing it right.\\nThere is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power or our will. \\nMost of us must learn to love people and use things rather than loving things and using people.\\nThe belief that unhappiness is selfless and happiness is selfish is misguided. It\\'s more selfless to act happy. It takes energy, generosity, and discipline to be unfailingly lighthearted, yet everyone takes the happy person for granted. No one is careful of his feelings or tries to keep his spirits high. He seems self-sufficient; he becomes a cushion for others. And because happiness seems unforced, that person usually gets no credit.\\nYou cannot be with someone just because you donâ\\x80\\x99t want to hurt him. You have your own happiness to think about.\\nIt is a curious thing, but as one travels the world getting older and older, it appears that happiness is easier to get used to than despair. The second time you have a root beer float, for instance, your happiness at sipping the delicious concoction may not be quite as enormous as when you first had a root beer float, and the twelfth time your happiness may be still less enormous, until root beer floats begin to offer you very little happiness at all, because you have become used to the taste of vanilla ice cream and root beer mixed together. However, the second time you find a thumbtack in your root beer float, your despair is much greater than the first time, when you dismissed the thumbtack as a freak accident rather than part of the scheme of a soda jerk, a phrase which here means \"ice cream shop employee who is trying to injure your tongue,\" and by the twelfth time you find a thumbtack, your despair is even greater still, until you can hardly utter the phrase \"root beer float\" without bursting into tears. It is almost as if happiness is an acquired taste, like coconut cordial or ceviche, to which you can eventually become accustomed, but despair is something surprising each time you encounter it.\\nAll who joy would win\\nCertainly the most destructive vice if you like, that a person can have. More than pride, which is supposedly the number one of the cardinal sins - is self pity. Self pity is the worst possible emotion anyone can have. And the most destructive. It is, to slightly paraphrase what Wilde said about hatred, and I think actually hatred\\'s a subset of self pity and not the other way around - \\' It destroys everything around it, except itself \\'.\\nSuccess is getting what you want..\\nWhy Not You?\\nBe believing, be happy, don\\'t get discouraged. Things will work out.\\nWhen you find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him, who will stand in front of you when otherâ\\x80\\x99s cast stones, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who will hold your hand when your sick, who thinks your pretty without makeup, the one who turns to his friends and say, â\\x80\\x98thatâ\\x80\\x99s herâ\\x80\\x99, the one that would bear your rejection because losing you means losing his will to live, who kisses you when you screw up, watches the stars and names one for you and will hold and rock that baby for hours so you can sleepâ\\x80¦..you marry him all over again.\\nSometimes you break your heart in the right way, if you know what I mean.\\nHappy girls are the prettiest\\nAll I ask is one thing, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m asking this particularly of young people: please donâ\\x80\\x99t be cynical. I hate cynicism, for the record, itâ\\x80\\x99s my least favorite quality and it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get. But if you work really hard and youâ\\x80\\x99re kind, amazing things will happen.\\nMy God, a moment of bliss. Why, isn\\'t that enough for a whole lifetime?\\nHappiness.

I turn toward him, wondering which version of Four I\\'ll see now-the one who scolds me, or the one who climbs Ferris wheels with me. He smiles a little, but the smile doesn\\'t spread to his eyes, which look less tense and worried.\\nIt is difficult to live in and enjoy the moment when you are thinking about the past or worrying about the future. You cannot change your past, but you can ruin the present by worrying about your future. Learn from the past, plan for the future. The more you live in and enjoy the present moment, the happier you will be.\\nOne swallow does not make a summer, neither does one fine day; similarly one day or brief time of happiness does not make a person entirely happy.\\nHappiness is a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting some on yourself.\\nDance. Smile. Giggle. Marvel. TRUST. HOPE. LOVE. WISH. BELIEVE. Most of all, enjoy every moment of the journey, and appreciate where you are at this moment instead of always focusing on how far you have to go.\\nWoman is not made to be the admiration of all, but the happiness of one.\\nLove is too precious to be ashamed of.\\nHappiness was but the occasional episode in a general drama of pain.\\nWe\\'re all golden sunflowers inside.\\nArt is unquestionably one of the purest and highest elements in human happiness.

As the sun colors flowers, so does art color life.\\nNothing makes a person happier than having a happy heart.\\nJust because you are happy it does not mean that the day is perfect but that you have looked beyond its imperfections\\nChanging your outside world cannot make you happy if you are an unhappy person. The real personal change can only happen from the inside out. If you firstly create the change within yourself, you can turn your life around.\\nThe trick is in what one emphasizes. We either make ourselves miserable, or we make ourselves happy. The amount of work is the same.\\nLater she remembered all the hours of the afternoon as happy -- one of those uneventful times that seem at the moment only a link between past and future pleasure, but turn out to have been the pleasure itself.\\nWe all live with the objective of being happy; our lives are all different and yet the same.\\nWe buy things we don\\'t need with money we don\\'t have to impress people we don\\'t like.\\nMy past has not defined me, destroyed me, deterred me, or defeated me; it has only strengthened me.\\nPlant seeds of happiness, hope, success, and love; it will all come back to you in abundance.

That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn\\'t depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions.\\n[F]or just one second, look at your life and see how perfect it is. Stop looking for the next secret door that is going to lead you to your real life. Stop waiting. This is it: there\\'s nothing else. It\\'s here, and you\\'d better decide to enjoy it or you\\'re going to be miserable wherever you go, for the rest of your life, forever.\\nOnly the development of compassion and understanding for others can bring us the tranquility and happiness we all seek.\\nI don\\'t understand the point of being together if you\\'re not the happiest.\\nObscurity and a competenceâ\\x80\\x94that is the life that is best worth living.\\nIt is a happiness to wonder; -- it is a happiness to dream.\\nHappy.

All alone and free in the soft sands of the beach by the sigh of the sea out there, with the Ma-Wink fallopian virgin warm stars reflecting on the outer channel fluid belly waters. And if your cans are redhot and you can\\'t hold them in your hands, just use good old railroad gloves, that\\'s all.\\nWe should always make time for the things we like. If we don\\'t, we might forget how to be happy.\\nHappiness depends on being free, and freedom depends on being courageous.\\nYou have to participate relentlessly in the manifestation of your own blessings.\\nListen to what is being preached today. Look at everyone around us. You\\'ve wondered why they suffer, why they seek happiness and never find it. If any man stopped and asked himself whether he\\'s ever held a truly personal desire, he\\'d find the answer. He\\'d see that all his wishes, his efforts, his dreams, his ambitions are motivated by other men. He\\'s not really struggling even for material wealth, but for the second-hander\\'s delusion - prestige. A stamp of approval, not his own. He can find no joy in the struggle and no joy when he has succeeded. He can\\'t say about a single thing: \\'This is what I wanted because I wanted it, not because it made my neighbors gape at me\\'. Then he wonders why he\\'s unhappy.\\nFeathers filled the small room. Our laughter kept the feathers in the air. I thought about birds. Could they fly if there wasn\\'t someone, somewhere, laughing?\\nThe true measure of success is how many times you can bounce back from failure.\\nMemory is the happiness of being alone.\\nIs anyone anywhere happy?\\nThe foundation of irreligious criticism is: Man makes religion, religion does not make man. Religion is, indeed, the self-consciousness and self-esteem of man who has either not yet won through to himself, or has already lost himself again. But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man â\\x80\\x93 state, society. This state and this society produce religion, which is an inverted consciousness of the world, because they are an inverted world...\\nMaybe happiness didn\\'t have to be about the big, sweeping circumstances, about having everything in your life in place. Maybe it was about stringing together a bunch of small pleasures. Wearing slippers and watching the Miss Universe contest. Eating a brownie with vanilla ice cream. Getting to level seven in Dragon Master and knowing there were twenty more levels to go.\\nThere are two ways to be happy: improve your reality, or lower your expectations.\\nI believe compassion to be one of the few things we can practice that will bring immediate and long-term happiness to our lives. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not talking about the short-term gratification of pleasures like sex, drugs or gambling (though Iâ\\x80\\x99m not knocking them), but something that will bring true and lasting happiness. The kind that sticks.\\nPeople tend to think that happiness is a stroke of luck, something that will descend like fine weather if you\\'re fortunate. But happiness is the result of personal effort. You fight for it, strive for it, insist upon it, and sometimes even travel around the world looking for it. You have to participate relentlessly.\\nHappiness only real when shared.\\nExpectations make people miserable, so whatever yours are, lower them. You\\'ll definitely be happier.\\nMany people think excitement is happiness.... But when you are excited you are not peaceful. True happiness is based on peace.\\nI am intrigued by the smile upon your face, and the sadness within your eyes\\nIt\\'s a helluva start, being able to recognize what makes you happy. \\nYou must be the best judge of your own happiness.\\nHumanity does not ask us to be happy. It merely asks us to be brilliant on its behalf.\\nPeople wait around too long for love. I\\'m happy with all of my lusts!\\nThere is no beauty in sadness. No honor in suffering. No growth in fear.

This perspective is at the heart of Buddhist teachings.\\nSeize the moments of happiness, love and be loved! That is the only reality in the world, all else is folly. It is the one thing we are interested in here.\\nBut maybe happiness isn\\'t in the choosing. Maybe it\\'s in the fiction, in the pretending: that wherever we have ended up is where we intended to be all along.\\nSome people are so much sunshine to the square inch.\\nAlways forgive, but never forget, else you will be a prisoner of your own hatred, and doomed to repeat your mistakes forever.\\nWhen you are joyful, when you say yes to life and have fun and project positivity all around you, you become a sun in the center of every constellation, and people want to be near you.\\nTo be stupid, and selfish, and to have good health are the three requirements for happiness - though if stupidity is lacking, the others are useless.\\nBecause children grow up, we think a child\\'s purpose is to grow up. But a child\\'s purpose is to be a child. Nature doesn\\'t disdain what lives only for a day. It pours the whole of itself into the each moment. We don\\'t value the lily less for not being made of flint and built to last. Life\\'s bounty is in its flow, later is too late. Where is the song when it\\'s been sung? The dance when it\\'s been danced? It\\'s only we humans who want to own the future, too. We persuade ourselves that the universe is modestly employed in unfolding our destination. We note the haphazard chaos of history by the day, by the hour, but there is something wrong with the picture. Where is the unity, the meaning, of nature\\'s highest creation? Surely those millions of little streams of accident and wilfulness have their correction in the vast underground river which, without a doubt, is carrying us to the place where we\\'re expected! But there is no such place, that\\'s why it\\'s called utopia. The death of a child has no more meaning than the death of armies, of nations. Was the child happy while he lived? That is a proper question, the only question. If we can\\'t arrange our own happiness, it\\'s a conceit beyond vulgarity to arrange the happiness of those who come after us.\\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s how stories happen â\\x80\\x94 with a turning point, an unexpected twist. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s only one kind of happiness, but misfortune comes in all shapes and sizes. Itâ\\x80\\x99s like Tolstoy said. Happiness is an allegory, unhappiness a story.\\nSo he tasted the deep pain that is reserved only for the strong, just as he had tasted for a little while the deep happiness.\\nFreedom is the only worthy goal in life. It is won by disregarding things that lie beyond our control.\\nThe great source of both the misery and disorders of human life, seems to arise from over-rating the difference between one permanent situation and another. Avarice over-rates the difference between poverty and riches: ambition, that between a private and a public station: vain-glory, that between obscurity and extensive reputation. The person under the influence of any of those extravagant passions, is not only miserable in his actual situation, but is often disposed to disturb the peace of society, in order to arrive at that which he so foolishly admires. The slightest observation, however, might satisfy him, that, in all the ordinary situations of human life, a well-disposed mind may be equally calm, equally cheerful, and equally contented. Some of those situations may, no doubt, deserve to be preferred to others: but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardour which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice; or to corrupt the future tranquillity of our minds, either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly, or by remorse from the horror of our own injustice.\\nA flower blossoms for its own joy.\\nÃ\\x94, Sunlight! The most precious gold to be found on Earth.\\nI am not good at noticing when I\\'m happy, except in retrospect.\\nThese... things, householder, are welcome, agreeable, pleasant, & hard to obtain in the world:\\nSinging in the rain. I\\'m singing in the rain. And it\\'s such a fucking glorious feeling. An unexpected downpour and I am just giving myself into it. Because what the fuck else can you do? Run for cover? Shriek and curse? No--when the rain falls you just let it fall and you grin like a madman and you dance with it because if you can make yourself happy in the rain, then you\\'re doing pretty alright in life.\\nCan a person steal happiness? Or is just another internal, infernal human trick?\\nHappiness, you see, its just an illusion of Fate, a heavenly sleight of hand designed to make you believe in fairy tales. But there\\'s no happily ever after. You\\'ll only find happy endings in books. Some books.\\nLife is such unutterable hell, solely because it is sometimes beautiful. If we could only be miserable all the time, if there could be no such things as love or beauty or faith or hope, if I could be absolutely certain that my love would never be returned: how much more simple life would be. One could plod through the Siberian salt mines of existence without being bothered about happiness. Unfortunately the happiness is there. There is always the chance (about eight hundred and fifty to one) that another heart will come to mine. I can\\'t help hoping, and keeping faith, and loving beauty. Quite frequently I am not so miserable as it would be wise to be.\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t think man was meant to attain happiness so easily. Happiness is like those palaces in fairy tales whose gates are guarded by dragons: we must fight in order to conquer it.\\nHappiness is not achieved by the conscious pursuit of happiness; it is generally the by-product of other activities.\\nIf you have any young friends who aspire to become writers, the second greatest favor you can do them is to present them with copies of The Elements of Style. The first greatest, of course, is to shoot them now, while theyâ\\x80\\x99re happy.\\nThe capacity to be alone is the capacity to love. It may look paradoxical to you, but it\\'s not. It is an existential truth: only those people who are capable of being alone are capable of love, of sharing, of going into the deepest core of another person--without possessing the other, without becoming dependent on the other, without reducing the other to a thing, and without becoming addicted to the other. They allow the other absolute freedom, because they know that if the other leaves, they will be as happy as they are now. Their happiness cannot be taken by the other, because it is not given by the other.\\nThe present moment is filled with joy and happiness. If you are attentive, you will see it. (21)\\nThe secret of happiness is not in doing what one likes, but in liking what one does.\\nThere are random moments - tossing a salad, coming up the driveway to the house, ironing the seams flat on a quilt square, standing at the kitchen window and looking out at the delphiniums, hearing a burst of laughter from one of my children\\'s rooms - when I feel a wavelike rush of joy. This is my true religion: arbitrary moments of of nearly painful happiness for a life I feel privileged to lead.\\nWhat disturbs and depresses young people is the hunt for happiness on the firm assumption that it must be met with in life. From this arises constantly deluded hope and so also dissatisfaction. Deceptive images of a vague happiness hover before us in our dreams, and we search in vain for their original. Much would have been gained if, through timely advice and instruction, young people could have had eradicated from their minds the erroneous notion that the world has a great deal to offer them.\\nLife is painful. It has thorns, like the stem of a rose. Culture and art are the roses that bloom on the stem. The flower is yourself, your humanity. Art is the liberation of the humanity inside yourself.\\nPerfect love casts out fear. Where there is love there are no demands, no expectations, no dependency. I do not demand that you make me happy; my happiness does not lie in you. If you were to leave me, I will not feel sorry for myself; I enjoy your company immensely, but I do not cling.\\nThe foolish man seeks happiness in the distance. The wise grows it under his feet.\\nHappiness is part of who we are. Joy is the feeling\\nI think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy because they know what itâ\\x80\\x99s like to feel absolutely worthless and they donâ\\x80\\x99t want anyone else to feel like that.\\nYou don\\'t ask people with knives in their stomachs what would make them happy; happiness is no longer the point. It\\'s all about survival; it\\'s all about whether you pull the knife out and bleed to death or keep it in...\\nHappiness is a choice that requires effort at times.\\nWhen you lose your smile, you lose your way in the chaos of life.\\nThose born to wealth, and who have the means of gratifying every wish, know not what is the real happiness of life, just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather.\\nIf I had a camera,\" I said, \"I\\'d take a picture of you every day. That way I\\'d remember how you looked every single day of your life.\"\\nTruly amazing, what people can get used to, as long as there are a few compensations.\\nMaybe you think youâ\\x80\\x99ll be entitled to more happiness later by forgoing all of it now, but it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t work that way. Happiness takes as much practice as unhappiness does. Itâ\\x80\\x99s by living that you live more. By waiting you wait more. Every waiting day makes your life a little less. Every lonely day makes you a little smaller. Every day you put off your life makes you less capable of living it.\\nThere were two ways to be happy: improve your reality, or lower your expectations\\nI was something that lay under the sun and felt it, like the pumpkins, and I did not want to be anything more. I was entirely happy. Perhaps we feel like that when we die and become a part of something entire, whether it is sun and air, or goodness and knowledge. At any rate, that is happiness; to be dissolved into something complete and great. When it comes to one, it comes as naturally as sleep.\\nI consider myself a stained-glass window. And this is how I live my life. Closing no doors and covering no windows; I am the multi-colored glass with light filtering through me, in many different shades. Allowing light to shed and fall into many many hues. My job is not to direct anything, but only to filter into many colors. My answer is destiny and my guide is joy. And there you have me.\\nMy only regrets are the moments when i doubted myself and took the safe route. Life is too short to waste time being unhappy.\\nnothing wonderful lasted forever. Joy was as fleeting as a shooting star that crossed the evening sky, ready to blink out at any moment.\\nI shall take the heart. [...] For brains do not make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.\\nTo see and feel one\\'s beloved naked for the first time is one of life\\'s pure, irreducible epiphanies. If there is a true religion in the universe, it must include that truth of contact or be forever hollow. To make love to the one true person who deserves that love is one of the few absolute rewards of being a human being, balancing all of the pain, loss, awkwardness, loneliness, idiocy, compromise, and clumsiness that go with the human condition. To make love to the right person makes up for a lot of mistakes.\\nIn fact no one recognizes the happiest moment of their lives as they are living it. It may well be that, in a moment of joy, one might sincerely believe that they are living that golden instant \"now,\" even having lived such a moment before, but whatever they say, in one part of their hearts they still believe in the certainty of a happier moment to come. Because how could anyone, and particularly anyone who is still young, carry on with the belief that everything could only get worse: If a person is happy enough to think he has reached the happiest moment of his life, he will be hopeful enough to believe his future will be just as beautiful, more so.\\nIt was that impossible thing: happiness that does not wilt to reveal the thin shoots of some new desire rising from within it.\\nHide yourself in God, so when a man wants to find you he will have to go there first.\\nØ¥Ù\\x86 Ø§Ù\\x84Ø³Ø¹Ø§Ø¯Ø© Ù\\x87Ù\\x8a Ø£Ù\\x86 Ø£Ø´Ø±Ø¨ Ù\\x83Ù\\x88Ø¨ Ø´Ø§Ù\\x8a..

I chose you.\\nWhat sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. These are but trifles, to be sure; but scattered along life\\'s pathway, the good they do is inconceivable.\\nWe are not going to change the whole world, but we can change ourselves and feel free as birds. We can be serene even in the midst of calamities and, by our serenity, make others more tranquil. Serenity is contagious. If we smile at someone, he or she will smile back. And a smile costs nothing. We should plague everyone with joy. If we are to die in a minute, why not die happily, laughing? (136-137)\\nYou, of all people, deserve a happy ending. Despite everything that happened to you, you aren\\'t bitter. You aren\\'t cold. You\\'ve just retreated a little and been shy, and that\\'s okay. If I were a fairy godmother, I would give you your heart\\'s desire in an istant. And I would wipe away your tears and tell you not to cry.\\nUntil you make peace with who you are, you\\'ll never be content with what you have.\\nThere is a kind of happiness and wonder that makes you serious. It is too good to waste on jokes.\\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s life for you. All the happiness you gather to yourself, it will sweep away like itâ\\x80\\x99s nothing. If you ask me I donâ\\x80\\x99t think there are any such things as curses. I think there is only life. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s enough.\\nHappiness doesn\\'t lie in conspicuous consumption and the relentless amassing of useless crap. Happiness lies in the person sitting beside you and your ability to talk to them. Happiness is clear-headed human interaction and empathy. Happiness is home. And home is not a house-home is a mythological conceit. It is a state of mind. A place of communion and unconditional love. It is where, when you cross its threshold, you finally feel at peace.\\nGrowing old is mandatory. Growing up is optional.\\nDestiny is real. And she\\'s not mild-mannered. She will come around and hit you in the face and knock you over and before you know what hit you, you\\'re naked- stripped of everything you thought you knew and everything you thought you didn\\'t know- and there you are! A bloody nose, bruises all over you, and naked. And it\\'s the most beautiful thing.\\nI may never be happy, but tonight I am content.\\nHappiness is like those palaces in fairytales whose gates are guarded by dragons: We must fight in order to conquer it.\\nAhhh. Bed, book, kitten, sandwich. All one needed in life, really.\\nThe reason people find it so hard to be happy is that they always see the past better than it was, the present worse than it is, and the future less resolved than it will be.\\nLaughter is a sunbeam of the soul.\\nTo be stupid, selfish, and have good health are three requirements for happiness, though if stupidity is lacking, all is lost.\\nSome day you will find out that there is far more happiness in another\\'s happiness than in your own.\\ndear today,\\nMy happiness grows in direct proportion to my acceptance, and in inverse proportion to my expectations.\\nHappiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God.\\nFor those who are poor in happiness, each time is a first time; happiness never becomes a habit.\\nDustfinger still clearly remembered the feeling of being in love for the first time.

Holding your uniqueness in high regard is not \\'egotism.\\' It\\'s a necessary precondition to happiness and success.\\nHappiness is the most natural thing in the world when you have it, and the slowest, strangest, most impossible thing when you don\\'t. It\\'s like learning a foreign language: You can think about the words all you want, but you\\'ll never be able to speak it until you suck up your courage and say them out loud.\\nExactly. How can you know it makes you happy if youâ\\x80\\x99ve never experienced it?\\nIt\\'s a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack.\\nIt is indisputable that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low, has the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied; and a highly endowed being will always feel that any happiness which he can look for, as the world is constituted, is imperfect. But he can learn to bear its imperfections, if they are at all bearable; and they will not make him envy the being who is indeed unconscious of the imperfections, but only because he feels not at all the good which those imperfections qualify.\\nIt isn\\'t what you have, or who you are, or where you are, or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about.\\nOne is happy as a result of one\\'s own efforts once one knows the necessary ingredients of happiness: simple tastes, a certain degree of courage, self denial to a point, love of work, and above all, a clear conscience.\\nWhy? Why does what was beautiful suddenly shatter in hindsight because it concealed dark truths? Why does the memory of years of happy marriage turn to gall when our partner is revealed to have had a lover all those years? Because such a situation makes it impossible to be happy? But we were happy! Sometimes the memory of happiness cannot stay true because it ended unhappily. Because happiness is only real if it lasts forever? Because things always end painfully if they contained pain, conscious or unconscious, all along? But what is unconscious, unrecognized pain?\\nA woman laughing is a woman conquered.\\nThe secret of happiness is to face the fact that the world is horrible, horrible, horrible.\\nThere was a thing called Heaven; but all the same they used to drink enormous quantities of alcohol.\"\\nHuman happiness and moral duty are inseparably connected.\\nBeauty is the purest feeling of the soul. Beauty arises when soul is satisfied.\\nI may never be happy, but tonight I am content. Nothing more than an empty house, the warm hazy weariness from a day spent setting strawberry runners in the sun, a glass of cool sweet milk, and a shallow dish of blueberries bathed in cream. When one is so tired at the end of a day one must sleep, and at the next dawn there are more strawberry runners to set, and so one goes on living, near the earth. At times like this I\\'d call myself a fool to ask for more...\\nThe true measure of a man is how he treats you when others are not looking.\\nSometimes we must undergo hardships, breakups, and narcissistic wounds, which shatter the flattering image that we had of ourselves, in order to discover two truths: that we are not who we thought we were; and that the loss of a cherished pleasure is not necessarily the loss of true happiness and well-being. (109)\\nOur way of thinking creates good or bad outcomes.\\nWhy should we build our happiness on the opinons of others, when we can find it in our own hearts?\\nYou have everything you need for complete peace and total happiness right now.\\nYou were already in a prison. You\\'ve been in a prison all your life. Happiness is a prison, Evey. Happiness is the most insidious prison of all. Your lover lived in the penitentiary that we are all born into, and was forced to rake the dregs of that world for his living. He knew affection and tenderness but only briefly. Eventually, one of the other inmates stabbed him with a cutlass and he drowned upon his own blood. Is that it, Evey? Is that the happiness worth more than freedom? It\\'s not an uncommon story, Evey. Many convicts meet with miserable ends. Your mother. Your father. Your lover. One by one, taken out behind the chemical sheds... and shot. All convicts, hunched and deformed by the smallness of their cells, the weight of their chains, the unfairness of their sentences. I didn\\'t put you in a prison, Evey. I just showed you the bars.\\'\\nThey\\'ll say you are bad\\nWe really have to understand the person we want to love. If our love is only a will to possess, it is not love. If we only think of ourselves, if we know only our own needs and ignore the needs of the other person, we cannot love. We must look deeply in order to see and understand the needs, aspirations, and suffering of the person we love. This is the ground of real love. You cannot resist loving another person when you really understand him or her.\\nDear Human:\\nI don\\'t know what your destiny will be, but one thing I know: the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have sought and found how to serve.\\nYour success and happiness are forgiven you only if you generously consent to share them. But to be happy it is essential not to be too concerned with others. Consequently, there is no escape. Happy and judged, or absolved and wretched.\\nA man wants to earn money in order to be happy, and his whole effort and the best of a life are devoted to the earning of that money. Happiness is forgotten; the means are taken for the end.\\nControl of consciousness determines the quality of life.\\nI think, that if the world were a bit more like ComicCon, it would be a better place.\\nThe way I define happiness is being the creator of your experience, choosing to take pleasure in what you have, right now, regardless of the circumstances, while being the best you that you can be.\\nHappiness is not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort.\\nHappiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort.\\nLove yourself. Forgive yourself. Be true to yourself. How you treat yourself sets the standard for how others will treat you.\\nWe have to go. I\\'m almost happy here.\\nA large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of.\\nHappiness is excitement that has found a settling down place, but there is always a little corner that keeps flapping around.\\nIf you\\'ve got nothing to dance about, find a reason to sing.\\nThe more you talk about it, rehash it, rethink it, cross analyze it, debate it, respond to it, get paranoid about it, compete with it, complain about it, immortalize it, cry over it, kick it, defame it, stalk it, gossip about it, pray over it, put it down or dissect its motives it continues to rot in your brain. It is dead. It is over. It is gone. It is done. It is time to bury it because it is smelling up your life and no one wants to be near your rotted corpse of memories and decaying attitude. Be the funeral director of your life and bury that thing!\\nWith my eyes closed, I would touch a familiar book and draw its fragrance deep inside me. This was enough to make me happy. \\nAdrian tipped my face up toward his and kissed me. Like always, the world around me stopped moving. No, the world became Adrian, only Adrian. Kissing him was as mind-blowing as ever, full of that same passion and need I had never believed Iâ\\x80\\x99d feel. But today, there was even more to it. I no longer had any doubt about whether this was wrong or right. It was a culmination of a long journey . . . or maybe the beginning of one.\\nHappiness and the absurd are two sons of the same earth. They are inseparable.\\nHappiness is a myth. It was invented to make us buy new things.\\nNothing is miserable unless you think it so; and on the other hand, nothing brings happiness unless you are content with it.\\nIf happy I can be I will, if suffer I must I can.\\nRules for happiness: something to do, someone to love, something to hope for.\\nIt is almost as if happiness is an acquired taste, like coconut cordial or ceviche, to which you can eventually become accustomed, but despair is something surprising each time you encounter it.\\nFor what prevents us from saying that the happy life is to have a mind that is free, lofty, fearless and steadfast - a mind that is placed beyond the reach of fear, beyond the reach of desire, that counts virtue the only good, baseness the only evil, and all else but a worthless mass of things, which come and go without increasing or diminishing the highest good, and neither subtract any part from the happy life nor add any part to it?\\nHappiness is a state of activity.\\nWhen your back is to the wall and you are facing fear head on, the only way is forward and through it.\\nBe happy in the moment, that\\'s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more.\\nThe single greatest lesson the garden teaches is that our relationship to the planet need not be zero-sum, and that as long as the sun still shines and people still can plan and plant, think and do, we can, if we bother to try, find ways to provide for ourselves without diminishing the world. \\nI\\'m going to enjoy every second, and I\\'m going to know I\\'m enjoying it while I\\'m enjoying it. Most people don\\'t live; they just race. They are trying to reach some goal far away on the horizon, and in the heat of the going they get so breathless and panting that they lose sight of the beautiful, tranquil country they are passing through; and then the first thing they know, they are old and worn out, and it doesn\\'t make any difference whether they\\'ve reached the goal or not.\\nLife is at its best when everything has fallen out of place, and you decide that you\\'re going to fight to get them right, not when everything is going your way and everyone is praising you.\\nSooner or later in life everyone discovers that perfect happiness is unrealizable, but there are few who pause to consider the antithesis: that perfect unhappiness is equally unattainable. The obstacles preventing the realization of both these extreme states are of the same nature: they derive from our human condition which is opposed to everything infinite.\\nHappiness is your nature. It is not wrong to desire it. What is wrong is seeking it outside when it is inside.\\nThere are a few moments in your life when you are truly and completely happy, and you remember to give thanks. Even as it happens you are nostalgic for the moment, you are tucking it away in your scrapbook.\\nYou can\\'t buy happiness\\nHappiness comes from helping others, by being with others, and by sharing, even if it\\'s only a smile.\\nBut I don\\'t want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness, I want sin.\\'\\nIf you fuel your journey on the opinions of others, you are going to run out of gas.\\nFrank heard a laugh behind him. He glanced back and couldn\\'t believe what he saw. Nico di Angelo was actually smiling.\\nCome clean with a child heart\\nHappiness can only be achieved by looking inward & learning to enjoy whatever life has and this requires transforming greed into gratitude.\\nEven in Siberia there is happiness.\\nShe had never imagined she had the power to make someone else so happy. And not a magical power, either--a purely human one.\\nHappiness comes from within. It is not dependent on external things or on other people. You become vulnerable and can be easily hurt when your feelings of security and happiness depend on the behavior and actions of other people. Never give your power to anyone else.\\nI keep remembering one of my Guru\\'s teachings about happiness. She says that people universally tend to think that happiness is a stroke of luck, something that will maybe descend upon you like fine weather if you\\'re fortunate enough. But that\\'s not how happiness works. Happiness is the consequence of personal effort. You fight for it, strive for it, insist upon it, and sometimes even travel around the world looking for it. You have to participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings. And once you have achieved a state of happiness, you must never become lax about maintaining it, you must make a mighty effort to keep swimming upward into that happiness forever, to stay afloat on top of it. If you don\\'t you will eat away your innate contentment. It\\'s easy enough to pray when you\\'re in distress but continuing to pray even when your crisis has passed is like a sealing process, helping your soul hold tight to its good attainments.\\nThat\\'s the big picture, your happiness. And health. You should never care what a man thinks of you -- until he demonstrates to you that he cares about making you happy. If he isn\\'t trying to make you happy, then send him back from \"whence\" he came because winning him over will have no benefit. At the end of the day, happines, joy...and yes...your emotional stability...those comprise the only measuring stick you really need to have.\\nHe whose face gives no light, shall never become a star.\\nLaughter is more than just a pleasurable activity...When people laugh together, they tend to talk and touch more and to make eye contact more frequently.\\nLaugh, and the world laughs with you;\\nAdrian smiled and clasped my hands, taking a few steps toward me. \"And as for who you are, youâ\\x80\\x99re the same beautiful, brave, and ridiculously smart caffeinated fighter youâ\\x80\\x99ve been since the day I met you. Finally, he put beautiful at the top of his list of adjectives. Not that I should have cared.\\nHow often since then has she wondered what might have happened if she\\'d tried to remain with him; if sheâ\\x80\\x99d returned Richard\\'s kiss on the corner of Bleeker and McDougal, gone off somewhere (where?) with him, never bought the packet of incense or the alpaca coat with rose-shaped buttons. Couldnâ\\x80\\x99t they have discovered something larger and stranger than what they\\'ve got. It is impossible not to imagine that other future, that rejected future, as taking place in Italy or France, among big sunny rooms and gardens; as being full of infidelities and great battles; as a vast and enduring romance laid over friendship so searing and profound it would accompany them to the grave and possibly even beyond. She could, she thinks, have entered another world. She could have had a life as potent and dangerous as literature itself.\\nThe supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved; loved for ourselvesâ\\x80\\x94say rather, loved in spite of ourselves.\\nDo not look for happiness outside yourself. The awakened seek happiness inside.\\nThree or four times only in my youth did I glimpse the Joyous Isles, before they were lost to fogs, depressions, cold fronts, ill winds, and contrary tides... I mistook them for adulthood. Assuming they were a fixed feature in my life\\'s voyage, I neglected to record their latitude, their longitude, their approach. Young ruddy fool. What wouldn\\'t I give now for a never-changing map of the ever-constant ineffable? To possess, as it were, an atlas of clouds.\\nMost people would rather be certain they\\'re miserable, than risk being happy.\\nYou see, there are some people that one loves, and others that perhaps one would rather be with.\\nSuccess will be within your reach only when you start reaching out for it.\\nRemember, happiness doesn\\'t depend upon who you are or what you have, it depends solely upon what you think.\\nPeople who can change and change again are so much more reliable and happier than those who canâ\\x80\\x99t\\nIf you think the story has a sad ending, it\\'s because it\\'s not over yet.\\nFlowers always make people better, happier, and more helpful; they are sunshine, food and medicine to the mind.\\nThe secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.\\nIt is a kind of spiritual snobbery that makes people think they can be happy without money.\\nThe discovery of a new dish does more for the happiness of the human race than the discovery of a star.\\nThe trick. . .is to find the balance between the bright colors of humor and the serious issues of identity, self-loathing, and the possibility for intimacy and love when it seems no longer possible or, sadder yet, no longer necessary.\\nShe was like the sun,\\nEvery time I thought I was being rejected from something good, I was actually being re-directed to something better.\\nBefore you can successfully make friends with others, first you have to become your own friend.\\nHurt is a part of life. To be honest, I think hurt is a part of happiness, that our definition of happiness has gotten very narrow lately, very nervous, a little afraid of this brawling, fabulous, unpredictable world.\\nNo one asked you to be happy. Get to work.\\nPeople who fit donâ\\x80\\x99t seek. The seekers are those that donâ\\x80\\x99t fit.\\nThe greatest gift you can ever give another person is your own happiness\\nWhen it can be said by any country in the world, my poor are happy, neither ignorance nor distress is to be found among them, my jails are empty of prisoners, my streets of beggars, the aged are not in want, the taxes are not oppressive, the rational world is my friend because I am the friend of happiness. When these things can be said, then may that country boast its constitution and government. Independence is my happiness, the world is my country and my religion is to do good.\\nAge does not make us childish, as some say; it finds us true children.\\nIf you are not the hero of your own story, then you\\'re missing the whole point of your humanity.\\nI do not think we have a \"right\" to happiness. If happiness happens, say thanks.\\nHappiness, like unhappiness, is a proactive choice.\\nA lot of the conflict you have in your life exists simply because you\\'re not living in alignment; you\\'re not be being true to yourself.\\nThe safest way of not being very miserable is not to expect to be very happy.\\nThat\\'s the secret to life... replace one worry with another....\\nThat is happiness; to be dissolved into something complete and great. When it comes to one, it comes as naturally as sleep.\\nSome people appear to be happy, but they simply don\\'t give the matter much thought. Others make plans: I\\'m going to have a husband, a home, two children, a house in the country. As long as they\\'re busy doing that, they\\'re like bulls looking for the bullfighter: they react instinctively, they blunder on, with no idea where the target is. They get their car, sometimes they even get a Ferrari, and they think that\\'s the meaning of life, and they never question it. Yet their eyes betray the sadness that even they don\\'t know they carry in their soul. Are you happy?\\nA disciplined mind leads to happiness, and an undisciplined mind leads to suffering.\\nEducation doesnâ\\x80\\x99t make you happy. Nor does freedom. We donâ\\x80\\x99t become happy just because weâ\\x80\\x99re free â\\x80\\x93 if we are. Or because weâ\\x80\\x99ve been educated â\\x80\\x93 if we have. But because education may be the means by which we realize we are happy. It opens our eyes, our ears, tells us where delights are lurking, convinces us that there is only one freedom of any importance whatsoever, that of the mind, and gives us the assurance â\\x80\\x93 the confidence â\\x80\\x93 to walk the path our mind, our educated mind, offers.\\nWell, I always know what I want. And when you know what you want--you go toward it. Sometimes you go very fast, and sometimes only an inch a year. Perhaps you feel happier when you go fast. I don\\'t know. I\\'ve forgotten the difference long ago, because it really doesn\\'t matter, so long as you move.\\nThe Anatomy of Conflict:\\nNo matter how small you start, always dream big.\\nAre you happy?\\nThe intention that man should be happy is not in the plan of Creation.\\nHe is richest who is content with the least, for content is the wealth of nature.\\nIt sometimes takes a state of solitude to bring to mind the real power of companionship.\\nThe best moments in our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing timesâ\\x80\\x94although such experiences can also be enjoyable, if we have worked hard to attain them. The best moments usually occur when a personâ\\x80\\x99s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.\\nThe big reason why folks leave a small town,\\' Rant used to say, \\'is so they can moon over the idea of going back. And the reason they stay put is so they can moon about getting out.\\'\\nWhen you are living the best version of yourself, you inspire others to live the best versions of themselves.\\nThey say all marriages are made in heaven, but so are thunder and lightning.\\nThe pretty ones are usually unhappy. They expect everyone to be enamored of their beauty. How can a person be content when their happiness lies in someone else\\'s hands, ready to be crushed at any moment? Ordinary-looking people are far superior, because they are forced to actually work hard to achieve their goals, instead of expecting people to fall all over themselves to help them.\\nIf you\\'re not making someone else\\'s life better, then you\\'re wasting your time. Your life will become better by making other lives better.\\nCompassion is the signature of Higher Consciousness. Non-violence is the tool to evolve into the Higher Consciousness.\\nFor what it\\'s worth, I think happiness is a fleeting condition, not a permanent state of goddamn mind. I\\'ve learned that if you chase after moments of bliss here and there, sometimes those moments will sustain you through the shit.\\nHappiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear\\nMany people are like garbage trucks. They run around full of garbage, full of frustration, full of anger, and full of disappointment. As their garbage piles up, they look for a place to dump it. And if you let them, theyâ\\x80\\x99ll dump it on you. So when someone wants to dump on you, donâ\\x80\\x99t take it personally. Just smile, wave, wish them well, and move on. Believe me. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll be happier.\\nI put my hand on the altar rail. \\'What if ... what if Heaven is real, but only in moments? Like a glass of water on a hot day when you\\'re dying of thirst, or when someone\\'s nice to you for no reason, or ...\\' Mam\\'s pancakes with Toblerone sauce; Dad dashing up from the bar just to tell me, \\'Sleep tight, don\\'t let the bedbugs bite\\'; or Jacko and Sharon singing \\'For She\\'s A Squishy Marshmallow\\' instead of \\'For She\\'s A Jolly Good Fellow\\' every single birthday and wetting themselves even though it\\'s not at all funny; and Brendan giving his old record player to me instead of one of his mates. \\'S\\'pose Heaven\\'s not like a painting that\\'s just hanging there for ever, but more like ... Like the best song anyone ever wrote, but a song you only catch in snatches, while you\\'re alive, from passing cars, or ... upstairs windows when you\\'re lost ...\\nTo serve is beautiful, but only if it is done with joy and a whole heart and a free mind.\\nYou have a unique gift to offer this world. Be true to yourself, be kind to yourself, read and learn about everything that interests you and keep away from people who bring you down. When you treat yourself kindly and respect the uniqueness of those around you, you will be giving this world an amazing gift... YOU!\\nJudgment is a negative frequency.\\nThere is strange comfort in knowing that no matter what happens today, the Sun will rise again tomorrow.\\nAs I focus on diligent joy, I also keep remembering a simple idea my friend Darcey told me once -- that all the sorrow and trouble of this world is caused by unhappy people. Not only in the big global Hitler-\\'n\\'-Stalin picture, but also on the smallest personal level. Even in my own life, I can see exactly where my episodes of unhappiness have brought suffering or distress or (at the very least) inconvenience to those around me. The search for contentment is, therefore, not merely a self-preserving and self-benefiting act, but also a generous gift to the world. Clearing out all your misery gets you out of the way. You cease being an obstacle, not only to yourself but to anyone else. Only then are you free to serve and enjoy other people.\\nCreate all the happiness you are able to create; remove all the misery you are able to remove. Every day will allow you, --will invite you to add something to the pleasure of others, --or to diminish something of their pains.\\nI like living in my head because in there, everyone is kind and innocent. Once you start integrating yourself into the world, you realize that people are nasty, mean creatures. They\\'re worse than zombies. People try to crush your soul and destroy your happiness, but zombies just want to have a little nibble of your brain.\\nGot no checkbooks, got no banks. Still I\\'d like to express my thanks - I\\'ve got the sun in the mornin\\' and the moon at night.\\nShe had been proud of his decision to serve his country, her heart bursting with love and admiration the first time she saw him outfitted in his dress blues. \\nInk runs from the corners of my mouth.\\nIt was their secret, a secret meant for just the two of them, and she\\'d never been able to imagine how it would sound coming from someone else. But, somehow, Logan made it sound just right.\\nPersonality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud.\\nThe happiest man is he who learns from nature the lesson of worship\\nWhether our action is wholesome or unwholesome depends on whether that action or deed arises from a disciplined or undisciplined state of mind. It is felt that a disciplined mind leads to happiness and an undisciplined mind leads to suffering, and in fact it is said that bringing about discipline within one\\'s mind is the essence of the Buddha\\'s teaching.\\nWhy not seize the pleasure at once? -- How often is happiness destroyed by preparation, foolish preparation!\\nWatch any plant or animal and let it teach you acceptance of what is, surrender to the Now.\\nOh, how unbearable is a happy person sometimes!\\nYou start dying slowly\\nAfter all, is not a real Hell better than a manufactured Heaven?\\nYou didn\\'t just cheat on me; you cheated on us. You didn\\'t just break my heart; you broke our future.\\nThe strength of a man isn\\'t seen in the power of his arms.

There is no more mistaken path to happiness than worldliness.\\nDeep within everyone\\'s heart there always remains a sense of longing for that hour, that summer, that one brief moment of blossoming. For several weeks or months, rarely longer, a beautiful young woman lives outside ordinary life. She is intoxicated. She feels as if she exists beyond time, beyond its laws; she experiences not the monotonous succession of days passing by, but moments of intense, almost desperate happiness.\\nThe primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation, but you thoughts about it. Be aware of the thoughts you are thinking.\\n...so i will greet you\\nPeople were always the limiters of happiness except for the very few that were as good as spring itself.\\nIf we never experience the chill of a dark winter, it is very unlikely that we will ever cherish the warmth of a bright summerâ\\x80\\x99s day. Nothing stimulates our appetite for the simple joys of life more than the starvation caused by sadness or desperation. In order to complete our amazing life journey successfully, it is vital that we turn each and every dark tear into a pearl of wisdom, and find the blessing in every curse.\\nHappiness does not come from without, it comes from within\\nHer happiness floated like waves of ocean along the coast of her life. She found lyrics of her life in his arms but she never sung her song.\\nI am still determined to be cheerful and happy, in whatever situation I may be; for I have also learned from experience that the greater part of our happiness or misery depends upon our dispositions, and not upon our circumstances. a\\n...is ignorance bliss, I don\\'t know, but it\\'s so painful to think, and tell me, what did thinking ever do for me, to what great place did thinking ever bring me? I think and think and think, I\\'ve thought myself out of happiness one million times, but never once into it.\\nThe victim mindset dilutes the human potential. By not accepting personal responsibility for our circumstances, we greatly reduce our power to change them.\\nThe hardest thing about depression is that it is addictive. It begins to feel uncomfortable not to be depressed. You feel guilty for feeling happy.\\nHappiness is not a life without pain, but rather a life in which the pain is traded for a worthy price.\\nWhen you\\'re unhappy, you get to pay a lot of attention to yourself. And you get to take yourself oh so very seriously. Your truly happy people, which is to say, your people who truly like themselves, they don\\'t think about themselves very much. Your unhappy person resents it when you try to cheer him up, because that means he has to stop dwellin\\' on himself and start payin\\' attention to the universe. Unhappiness is the ultimate form of self-indulgence.\\nMoney does not buy you happiness, but lack of money certainly buys you misery.\\nLive your life. Be happy as you can be, let go of the things that don\\'t matter, and fight.\\nPersonally I am very pessimistic. But when, for instance, one of my staff has a baby you can\\'t help but bless them for a good future. Because I can\\'t tell that child, \\'Oh, you shouldn\\'t have come into this life.\\' And yet I know the world is heading in a bad direction. So with those conflicting thoughts in mind, I think about what kind of films I should be making.\\nEverybody has something, that one thing they must do to feel happy. I think this is yours, and I want you to be happy. You donâ\\x80\\x99t have to do it, but itâ\\x80\\x99s here if you choose to come back to it.\\nYou know, people ask me. They say \\'Dan, three years later do you really want to be drawing cat whiskers on your face?\\' but they don\\'t understand. The cat whiskers, they come from within.\\nParadise was always over there, a dayâ\\x80\\x99s sail away. But itâ\\x80\\x99s a funny thing, escapism. You can go far and wide and you can keep moving on and on through places and years, but you never escape your own life. I, finally, knew where my life belonged. Home.\\nMara, that\\'s the life I want to give you. That\\'s what I\\'m offering you. I want to fill you life with color and warmth. I want to fill it with light. Give me a chance\\nHappiness is a state of mind, a choice, a way of living; it is not something to be achieved, it is something to be experienced.\\nWhat is a Wanderess? Bound by no boundaries, contained by no countries, tamed by no time, she is the force of natureâ\\x80\\x99s course.\\nJoy came always after pain.\\nHappiness\\nAn entire life spent reading would have fulfilled my every desire; I already knew that at the age of seven. The texture of the world is painful, inadequate; unalterable, or so it seems to me. Really, I believe that an entire life spent reading would have suited me best. Such a life has not been granted me...\\nSurely every one realizes, at some point along the way, that he is capable of living a far better life than the one he has chosen.\\nThe secret of being miserable is to have leisure to bother about whether you are happy or not. The cure for it is occupation, because occupation means pre-occupation; and the pre-occupied person is neither happy nor unhappy, but simply alive and active. That is why it is necessary to happiness that one should be tired.\\nAfter all the world is indeed beautiful and if we were any other creature than man we might be continuously happy in it.\\nSome people think they can find satisfaction in good food, fine clothes, lively music, and sexual pleasure. However, when they have all these things, they are not satisfied. They realize happiness is not simply having their material needs met. Thus, society has set up a system of rewards that go beyond material goods. These include titles, social recognition, status, and political power, all wrapped up in a package called self-fulfillment. Attracted by these prizes and goaded on by social pressure, people spend their short lives tiring body and mind to chase after these goals. Perhaps this gives them the feeling that they have achieved something in their lives, but in reality they have sacrificed a lot in life. They can no longer see, hear, act, feel, or think from their hearts. Everything they do is dictated by whether it can get them social gains. In the end, they\\'ve spent their lives following other people\\'s demands and never lived a life of their own. How different is this from the life of a slave or a prisoner?\\nToday only the person who no longer believes in a happy ending, only he who has consciously renounced it, is able to live. A happy century does not exist; but there are moments of happiness, and there is freedom in the moment.\\nWe are all happy if we but knew it.\\nSometimes you get everything you ever wanted, only it doesn\\'t look like what you wanted anymore.\\nThere\\'s a taste in the air, sweet and vaguely antiseptic, that reminds him of his teenage years in these streets, and of a general state of longing, a hunger for life to begin that from this distance seems like happiness.\\nThe most important thing is this: to be able at any moment to be free to choose a life that makes you happy.\\nA happy person is not a person in a certain set of circumstances, but rather a person with a certain set of attitudes.\\n[I]t is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible.\\nI think most people are just trying to be happy, and that most of their actions, however misguided, are in line with that goal. Most people just want to feel they belong somewhere, want to be loved, and want to feel they\\'re important to someone. If you really examine all the wrongheaded and messed-up things they do, they can most often be traced back to that basic desire. The abusers, the addicted, the cruel and unpleasant, the manipulators --these are just people who started this quest for happiness in the basement of their lives. Someone communicated to them through word or deed that they were undeserving, so they think they have to claw their way there over the backs of others, leaving scars and creating damage. Of course, they only create more misery for themselves and others.\\nHappiness wasn\\'t a mystical place to be reached or won--some bright terrain beyond the boundary of misery, a paradise waiting for them to find it--but something to carry doggedly with you through everything, as humble and ordinary as your gear and supplies.\\nHappy the man, and happy he alone,\\nÙ\\x84Ø§ Ø£Ø¹Ø±Ù\\x81 Ø£Ø¬Ø¯Ø§Ù\\x8b Ø¨Ù\\x8aÙ\\x86 Ø§Ù\\x84Ù\\x86Ø§Ø³ Ù\\x8aØ³ØªØ·Ù\\x8aØ¹ Ø£Ù\\x86 Ù\\x8aØ±Ø³Ù\\x85 Ù\\x84Ù\\x8a Ø®Ø·Ø© Ø³Ø¹Ø§Ø¯ØªÙ\\x8a Ù\\x83Ù\\x85Ø§ Ø£Ø±Ø³Ù\\x85Ù\\x87Ø§ Ù\\x84Ù\\x86Ù\\x81Ø³Ù\\x8a\\nThe summit of happiness is reached when a person is ready to be what he is.\\nAlways be like a water. Float in the times of pain or dance like waves along the wind which touches its surface.\\nNothing can illustrate these observations more forcibly, than a recollection of the happy conjuncture of times and circumstances, under which our Republic assumed its rank among the Nations; The foundation of our Empire was not laid in the gloomy age of Ignorance and Superstition, but at an Epoch when the rights of mankind were better understood and more clearly defined, than at any former period, the researches of the human mind, after social happiness, have been carried to a great extent, the Treasures of knowledge, acquired by the labours of Philosophers, Sages and Legislatures, through a long succession of years, are laid open for our use, and their collected wisdom may be happily applied in the Establishment of our forms of Government; the free cultivation of Letters, the unbounded extension of Commerce, the progressive refinement of Manners, the growing liberality of sentiment... have had a meliorating influence on mankind and increased the blessings of Society. At this auspicious period, the United States came into existence as a Nation, and if their Citizens should not be completely free and happy, the fault will be entirely their own.\\nI\\nDoing what you love is freedom.\\nIN THE HANDS OF MAN\\nTake all that you can of this book upon reason, and the balance on faith, and you will live and die a happier man.

The consumption society has made us feel that happiness lies in having things, and has failed to teach us the happiness of not having things.\\nI think probably kindness is my number one attribute in a human being. I\\'ll put it before any of the things like courage or bravery or generosity or anything else.\\nTo me, the meaning of a human life is to be happy. It\\'s to achieve happiness right now, it\\'s to make sure you\\'re happy in the future.\\nThe Christmas presents once opened are Not So Much Fun as they were while we were in the process of examining, lifting, shaking, thinking about, and opening them. Three hundred sixty-five days later, we try again and find that the same thing has happened. Each time the goal is reached, it becomes Not So Much Fun, and we\\'re off to reach the next one, then the next one, then the next.\\nThose only are happy (I thought) who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness; on the happiness of others, on the improvement of mankind, even on some art or pursuit, followed not as a means, but as itself an ideal end. Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness by the way. The enjoyments of life (such was now my theory) are sufficient to make it a pleasant thing, when they are taken en passant, without being made a principal object. Once make them so, and they are immediately felt to be insufficient. They will not bear a scrutinizing examination. Ask yourself whether you are happy, and you cease to be so. The only chance is to treat, not happiness, but some end external to it, as the purpose of life. Let your self-consciousness, your scrutiny, your self-interrogation, exhaust themselves on that; and if otherwise fortunately circumstanced you will inhale happiness with the air you breathe, without dwelling on it or thinking about it, without either forestalling it in imagination, or putting it to flight by fatal questioning.\\nEven if happiness forgets you a little bit, never completely forget about it.\\nThe institutions of human society treat us as parts of a machine. They assign us ranks and place considerable pressure upon us to fulfill defined roles. We need something to help us restore our lost and distorted humanity. Each of us has feelings that have been suppressed and have built up inside. There is a voiceless cry resting in the depths of our souls, waiting for expression. Art gives the soul\\'s feelings voice and form.\\nHappiness is not a state to arrive at, but a manner of traveling.\\ni have laughed\\nTo the European, it is a characteristic of the American culture that, again and again, one is commanded and ordered to \\'be happy.\\' But happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue. One must have a reason to \\'be happy.\\' Once the reason is found, however, one becomes happy automatically. As we see, a human being is not one in pursuit of happiness but rather in search of a reason to become happy, last but not least, through actualizing the potential meaning inherent and dormant in a given situation.\\nWhen you fail, that is when you get closer to success.\\nHappiness is such a fragile thing, isn\\'t it? So easily burst, like a bubble blown by a child, and always on the verge of being carried away.\\nI must die. Must I then die lamenting? I must be put in chains. Must I then also lament? I must go into exile. Does any man then hinder me from going with smiles and cheerfulness and contentment?\\nI find no importance in showing others that I am happy; it\\'s not important to me that they know or think that I am happy but what is important to me is that I am happy. I am interested in being happy, not in making others think or know that I am.\\nHe wore his happiness like a mask and the girl had run off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way of going to knock on her door and ask for it back.\\nUnhappy parents teach you a lesson that lasts a lifetime.\\nLove doesn\\'t make the world go \\'round; love is what makes the ride worthwhile.\\nI\\'ll never wake up in a good mood again.\\nCinderella was such a dork. She left behind her glass slipper at the ball and then went right back to her step-monster\\'s house. It seems to me she should have worn the glass slipper always, to make herself easier to find. I always hoped that after the prince found Cinderella and they rode away in their magnificent carriage, after a few miles she turned to him and said, \"Could you drop me off down the road please? Now that I\\'ve finally escaped my life of horrific abuse, I\\'d like to see something of the world, you know?...

They give them the best food and clothes they can afford, take their own kind of take on training kids to be honest and polite. But what they don\\'t realize is no matter how much they try, their kids will get out there. Out to this complicated little world. If they are lucky they will survive, through backstabbers, broken hearts, failures and all the kinds of invisible insane pressures out there. But most kids get lost in them. They will get caught up in all kinds of bubbles. Trouble bubbles. Bubbles that continuously tell them that they are not good enough. Bubbles that get them carried away with what they think is love, give them broken hearts. Bubbles that will blur the rest of the world to them, make them feel like that is it, that they\\'ve reached the end. Sometimes, even the really smart kids, make stupid decisions. They lose control. Parents need to realize that the world is getting complicated every second of every day. With new problems, new diseases, new habits. They have to realize the vast probability of their kids being victims of this age, this complicated era. Your kids could be exposed to problems that no kind of therapy can help. Your kids could be brainwashed by themselves to believe in insane theories that drive them crazy. Most kids will go through this stage. The lucky ones will understand. They will grow out of them. The unlucky ones will live in these problems. Grow in them and never move forward. They will cut themselves, overdose on drugs, take up excessive drinking and smoking, for the slightest problems in their lives.\\nThe greatest thing about dreams is they donâ\\x80\\x99t expire. They can lay dormant for years and when you pull them out and dust them off, they shine like new.\\nWhenever I see an ambulance, I like to think there is a baby being born, rather than a death.\\nI NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE POINT OF BEING SAD\\nI guess money can\\'t buy happiness if you shop in the wrong places.\\nMy advice to you is get married: if you find a good wife you\\'ll be happy; if not, you\\'ll become a philosopher.\\nEven if it were possible to cast my horoscope in this one life, and to make an accurate prediction about my future, it would not be possible to \\'show\\' it to me because as soon as I saw it my future would change by definition. This is why Werner Heisenberg\\'s adaptation of the Hays Officeâ\\x80\\x94the so-called principle of uncertainty whereby the act of measuring something has the effect of altering the measurementâ\\x80\\x94is of such importance. In my case the difference is often made by publicity. For example, and to boast of one of my few virtues, I used to derive pleasure from giving my time to bright young people who showed promise as writers and who asked for my help. Then some profile of me quoted someone who disclosed that I liked to do this. Then it became something widely said of me, whereupon it became almost impossible for me to go on doing it, because I started to receive far more requests than I could respond to, let alone satisfy. Perception modifies reality: when I abandoned the smoking habit of more than three decades I was given a supposedly helpful pill called Wellbutrin. But as soon as I discovered that this was the brand name for an antidepressant, I tossed the bottle away. There may be successful methods for overcoming the blues but for me they cannot include a capsule that says: \\'Fool yourself into happiness, while pretending not to do so.\\' I should actually want my mind to be strong enough to circumvent such a trick.\\nWhen we are collecting books, we are collecting happiness.\\nCake is happiness!

If you have a cake in front of you, you should not look any further for joy!\\nDoing the tough things sets winners apart from losers.\\nHapiness is as exclusive as a butterfly, and you must never pursue it. If you stay very still, it may come and settle on your hand. But only briefly. Savour those moments, for they will not come in your way very often.\\nShe laughed. \\'It won\\'t last. Nothing lasts. But I\\'m happy now.\\'\\nI cannot tell if what the world considers â\\x80\\x98happinessâ\\x80\\x99 is happiness or not. All I know is that when I consider the way they go about attaining it, I see them carried away headlong, grim and obsessed, in the general onrush of the human herd, unable to stop themselves or to change their direction. All the while they claim to be just on the point of attaining happiness.\\nThe crowning fortune of a man is to be born to some pursuit which finds him employment and happiness, whether it be to make baskets, or broadswords, or canals, or statues, or songs.\\nIt\\'s what\\'s in yourself that makes you happy or unhappy.\\nI want him to be happy. And I want you to be happy, too.

I prefer to think that happiness is always there, and that when things don\\'t go the way we might like them to, it\\'s a sign from above that something even better is right around the corner.\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s funny how one summer can change everything. It must be something about the heat and the smell of chlorine, fresh-cut grass and honeysuckle, asphalt sizzling after late-day thunderstorms, the steam rising while everything drips around it. Something about long, lazy days and whirring air conditioners and bright plastic flip-flops from the drugstore thwacking down the street. Something about fall being so close, another year, another Christmas, another beginning. So much in one summer, stirring up like the storms that crest at the end of each day, blowing out all the heat and dirt to leave everything gasping and cool. Everyone can reach back to one summer and lay a finger to it, finding the exact point when everything changed. That summer was mine.\\nRecipe For Happiness Khaborovsk Or Anyplace\\'\\nReason, Observation and Experience â\\x80\\x94 the Holy Trinity of Science â\\x80\\x94 have taught us that happiness is the only good; that the time to be happy is now, and the way to be happy is to make others so. This is enough for us. In this belief we are content to live and die. If by any possibility the existence of a power superior to, and independent of, nature shall be demonstrated, there will then be time enough to kneel. Until then, let us stand erect.\\nWe have no more right to consume happiness without producing it than to consume wealth without producing it.\\nHappiness is always a by-product. It is probably a matter of temperament, and for anything I know it may be glandular. But it is not something that can be demanded from life, and if you are not happy you had better stop worrying about it and see what treasures you can pluck from your own brand of unhappiness.\\nMost men either compromise or drop their greatest talents and start running after, what they perceive to be, a more reasonable success, and somewhere in between they end up with a discontented settlement. Safety is indeed stability, but it is not progression.\\nCome here, let me share a bit of wisdom with you.\\nWrite it on your heart you are the most beautiful soul of the Universe.

Let each seek one\\'s own way to the highest, to one\\'s own sense of supreme loyalty in life, one\\'s ideal of life.

Take THIS day, THIS moment and lead it to perfection.\\nIt was the general opinion of ancient nations, that the divinity alone was adequate to the important office of giving laws to men... and modern nations, in the consecrations of kings, and in several superstitious chimeras of divine rights in princes and nobles, are nearly unanimous in preserving remnants of it... Is the jealousy of power, and the envy of superiority, so strong in all men, that no considerations of public or private utility are sufficient to engage their submission to rules for their own happiness? Or is the disposition to imposture so prevalent in men of experience, that their private views of ambition and avarice can be accomplished only by artifice? â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80¦ There is nothing in which mankind have been more unanimous; yet nothing can be inferred from it more than this, that the multitude have always been credulous, and the few artful. The United States of America have exhibited, perhaps, the first example of governments erected on the simple principles of nature: and if men are now sufficiently enlightened to disabuse themselves of artifice, imposture, hypocrisy, and superstition, they will consider this event as an era in their history. Although the detail of the formation of the American governments is at present little known or regarded either in Europe or America, it may hereafter become an object of curiosity. It will never be pretended that any persons employed in that service had any interviews with the gods, or were in any degree under the inspiration of heaven, any more than those at work upon ships or houses, or labouring in merchandize or agriculture: it will for ever be acknowledged that these governments were contrived merely by the use of reason and the senses. As Copley painted Chatham, West, Wolf, and Trumbull, Warren and Montgomery; as Dwight, Barlow, Trumbull, and Humphries composed their verse, and Belknap and Ramzay history; as Godfrey invented his quadrant, and Rittenhouse his planetarium; as Boylston practised inoculation, and Franklin electricity; as Paine exposed the mistakes of Raynal, and Jefferson those of Buffon, so unphilosophically borrowed from the Recherches Philosophiques sur les AmÃ©ricains those despicable dreams of de Pauw â\\x80\\x94 neither the people, nor their conventions, committees, or sub-committees, considered legislation in any other light than ordinary arts and sciences, only as of more importance. Called without expectation, and compelled without previous inclination, though undoubtedly at the best period of time both for England and America, to erect suddenly new systems of laws for their future government, they adopted the method of a wise architect, in erecting a new palace for the residence of his sovereign. They determined to consult Vitruvius, Palladio, and all other writers of reputation in the art; to examine the most celebrated buildings, whether they remain entire or in ruins; compare these with the principles of writers; and enquire how far both the theories and models were founded in nature, or created by fancy: and, when this should be done, as far as their circumstances would allow, to adopt the advantages, and reject the inconveniences, of all. Unembarrassed by attachments to noble families, hereditary lines and successions, or any considerations of royal blood, even the pious mystery of holy oil had no more influence than that other of holy water: the people universally were too enlightened to be imposed on by artifice; and their leaders, or more properly followers, were men of too much honour to attempt it. Thirteen governments thus founded on the natural authority of the people alone, without a pretence of miracle or mystery, which are destined to spread over the northern part of that whole quarter of the globe, are a great point gained in favour of the rights of mankind.\\nAnd hard times are good in their own way, too. Because the only way you can achieve true happiness is if you experience true sadness as well. It\\'s all about light and shade. Balance.\\nEvery sunset is an opportunity to reset.\\nI believe that being happy is the only important thing. Happiness. Simple as a glass of chocolate or torturous as the heart. Bitter. Sweet. Alive.\\nHappiness is not something that you can find, acquire, or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and then wait. Some of those conditions are within you, such as coherence among the parts and levels of your personality. Other conditions require relationships to things beyond you: Just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and a connection to something larger. It is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself. If you get these relationships right, a sense of purpose and meaning will emerge.\\nIt seemed like this day could go in so many directions, like a spiderweb shooting out toward endless possibilities. Whenever you made a choice, especially one you\\'d been resisting, it always affected everything else, some in big ways, like a tremor beneath your feet, others in so tiny a shift you hardly noticed a change at all. But it was happening.\\nIt will hurt.\" said Petra. \"But let\\'s make the most of what we have, and not let future pain ruin present happiness.\\nI spit on your happiness!

You with your promise of a humdrum happiness--provided a person doesn\\'t ask much of life. I want everything of life, I do; and I want it now! I want it total, complete: otherwise I reject it! I will not be moderate. I will not be satisfied with the bit of cake you offer me if I promise to be a good little girl. I want to be sure of everything this very day; sure that everything will be as beautiful as when I was a little girl. If not, I want to die!\\nAlways remember that you were once alone, and the crowd you see in your life today are just as unecessary as when you were alone.\\nI needed to stop being what everyone thought I was.\\n[Fireheart]mewed,\"It\\'s not my place to judge you.\" Greystripe looked up as Fireheart went on.\" Greystripe, whatever you decide to do, I will always be your friend.\\nWe\\'d just shared the last beer and slung the empty can out the window at a stop sign and were just waiting back to get the feel of the day, swimming in that kind of tasty drowsiness that comes over you after a day of going hard at something you enjoy doing -- half sunburned and half drunk and keeping awake only because you wanted to savor the taste as long as you could.\\nI\\'m a happy person.

Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving, it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe.\\nIn a person\\'s lifetime there may be not more than half a dozen occasions that he can look back to in the certain knowledge that right then, at that moment, there was room for nothing but happiness in his heart.\\nI think people would be happier if they admitted things more often. In a sense we are all prisoners of some memory, or fear, or disappointment - we are all defined by something we canâ\\x80\\x99t change.\\nSometimes when I meet old friends, it reminds me how quickly time passes. And it makes me wonder if we\\'ve utilized our time properly or not. Proper utilization of time is so important. While we have this body, and especially this amazing human brain, I think every minute is something precious. Our day-to-day existence is very much alive with hope, although there is no guarantee of our future. There is no guarantee that tomorrow at this time we will be here. But we are working for that purely on the basis of hope. So, we need to make the best use of our time. I believe that the proper utilization of time is this: if you can, serve other people, other sentient beings. If not, at least refrain from harming them. I think that is the whole basis of my philosophy.\\nHappiness has to do with your mindset, not with outside circumstance.\\nDepression weighs you down like a rock in a river. You don\\'t stand a chance. You can fight and pray and hope you have the strength to swim, but sometimes, you have to let yourself sink. Because you\\'ll never know true happiness until someone or something pulls you back out of that river--and you\\'ll never believe it until you realize it was you, yourself who saved you.\\nIt sounded old. Deserve. Old and tired and beaten to death. Deserve. Now it seemed to him that he was always saying or thinking that he didn\\'t deserve some bad luck, or some bad treatment from others. He\\'d told Guitar that he didn\\'t \"deserve\" his family\\'s dependence, hatred, or whatever. That he didn\\'t even \"deserve\" to hear all the misery and mutual accusations his parents unloaded on him. Nor did he \"deserve\" Hagar\\'s vengeance. But why shouldn\\'t his parents tell him their personal problems? If not him, then who? And if a stranger could try to kill him, surely Hagar, who knew him and whom he\\'d thrown away like a wad of chewing gum after the flavor was goneâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x93she had a right to try to kill him too.\\nIndeed there has never been any explanation of the ebb and flow in our veins--of happiness and unhappiness.\\nSometimes pain is so unmanageable that the idea of spending another day with it seems impossible. Other times pain acts as a compass to help you get through the messier tunnels of growing up. But the pain can only help you find happiness if you can remember it.\\nShe avoids deep thought like an empty restaurant, not out of stupidity, but a canny resolve to be happy.\\nFor the likes of you, the path to happiness is one mean son of a bitch of a path.\\nI don\\'t want anyone to look to me, not for protection, not for happiness, not for love, not for anything.\\nAssociate with the noblest people you can find; read the best books; live with the mighty; but learn to be happy alone.\\nAccustom yourself to the belief that death is of no concern to us, since all good and evil lie in sensation and sensation ends with death. Therefore the true belief that death is nothing to us makes a mortal life happy, not by adding to it an infinite time, but by taking away the desire for immortality. For there is no reason why the man who is thoroughly assured that there is nothing to fear in death should find anything to fear in life. So, too, he is foolish who says that he fears death, not because it will be painful when it comes, but because the anticipation of it is painful; for that which is no burden when it is present gives pain to no purpose when it is anticipated. Death, the most dreaded of evils, is therefore of no concern to us; for while we exist death is not present, and when death is present we no longer exist. It is therefore nothing either to the living or to the dead since it is not present to the living, and the dead no longer are.\\nI remember watching it all and getting the tickling in my chest and thinking to myself: This is what happiness feels like.\\nand our few good times will be rare because we have the critical sense\\nToday, many will choose to live free of conditions and rules governing their own happiness. Why not you? Do not let another day go by where your dedication to other people\\'s opinions is greater than your dedication to your own emotions!

(\"Happy days are back again\")\\nThe secret of happiness: Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it.\\nHappiness is a gift and the trick is not to expect it, but to delight in it when it comes.\\nBe happy with who you are and what you do, and you can do anything you want.\\nHappiness is not the absence of problems; it\\'s the ability to deal with them.\\nLive life as though nobody is watching, and express yourself as though everyone is listening.\\nAny intelligent person knows that life is a beautiful thing and that the purpose of life is to be happy,\" said my father as he watched the three beauties. \"But it seems only idiots are ever happy. How can we explain this?\\nIf everything really does get better, the way everyone claims, then happiness should be graphable. But that\\'s crap, because better isn\\'t quantifiable.\\nThere is no list of rules. There is one rule. The rule is: there are no rules. Happiness comes from living as you need to, as you want to. As your inner voice tells you to. Happiness comes from being who you actually are instead of who you think you are supposed to be. Being traditional is not traditional anymore. Itâ\\x80\\x99s funny that we still think of it that way. Normalize your lives, people. You donâ\\x80\\x99t want a baby? Donâ\\x80\\x99t have one. I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to get married? I wonâ\\x80\\x99t. You want to live alone? Enjoy it. You want to love someone? Love someone. Donâ\\x80\\x99t apologize. Donâ\\x80\\x99t explain. Donâ\\x80\\x99t ever feel less than. When you feel the need to apologize or explain who you are, it means the voice in your head is telling you the wrong story. Wipe the slate clean. And rewrite it. No fairy tales. Be your own narrator. And go for a happy ending. One foot in front of the other. You will make it.\\nNo one can grant you happiness. Happiness is a choice we all have the power to make.\\nMarriage becomes hard work once you have poured the entirety of your lifeâ\\x80\\x99s expectations for happiness into the hands of one mere person. Keeping that going is hard work.\\nI\\'ve pursued dreams and achieved them, but I don\\'t think anybody should think their life is incomplete if they don\\'t follow some dream. Happiness doesn\\'t come from achievements, or money, or any sort of treasure. Happiness is a frame of mind, not a destination. It\\'s appreciating what you\\'ve got and building relationships with those around you.\\nAllow yourself to enjoy each happy moment in your life.\\nThere is no greater power than that of a laugh and happiness is a force which can save a person from the horrors of the world.\\nBe patient.

As one of my friends states on his Facebook profile: \"The true Losers in Life, are not those who Try and Fail, but those who Fail to Try.\\nLife is about balance. The good and the bad. The highs and the lows. The thing everyone should realize is that the key to happiness is being happy by yourself and for yourself. Happiness comes from within. You have the power to change your own mindset so that all the negative, horrible thoughts that try to invade your psyche are replaced with happy, positive, wonderful thoughts.\\nThe Wind Will Carry Us\\nIt\\'s in those quiet little towns, at the edge of the world, that you will find the salt of the earth people who make you feel right at home.\\nThe dead don\\'t desire revenge, but the happiness of the livng.

Sadly, they let their real talents go undeveloped, while they chase after fame. I am grateful for the people with obscure unremarked talents because they make our lives easier---inventors, organizers, planners, peacemakers, communicators, activists, scientists, and so forth. However, there is one gift that trumps all other talentsâ\\x80\\x94being an excellent parent.

That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil, in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to someone else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\\nMaybe if we stopped trying to achieve movie standards of greatness, we\\'d be happy with what we have.\\nLife is so short.

Itâ\\x80\\x99s time to break social norms and teach a healthier way of life! Itâ\\x80\\x99s time to teach good gender roles and to ditch the unnecessary ones. Does it really matter if your son likes the color pink? Is it going to hurt anybody? Do you not see the damage it inflicts to tell a boy that there is something wrong with him because he likes a certain color? Do we not see the damage we do in labeling our girls tom boys or our boys feminine just because they have their own likes and opinions on things?

I think it\\'s because I have confidence in you, in your thoughts. Do you understand? I love everything I see in you, and everything I don\\'t see.

People would be happier and healthier if they took longer vacations even if that meant earning less, yet vacation times are shrinking in the United States, and in Europe as well. People would be happier, and in the long run and wealthier, if they bought basic functional appliances, automobiles, and wristwatches, and invested the money they saved for future consumption; yet, Americans and in particular spend almost everything they have â\\x80\\x93 and sometimes more â\\x80\\x93 on goods for present consumption, often paying a large premium for designer names and superfluous features.\\nWhen I was in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, I watched (along with others) how many locals came to drink water from the fountain there. The people beside me said to each other \"Oh my goodness, how disgusting, people just drink water from anywhere,\" while the whole time, I was thinking \"Oh my goodness, how wonderful, people can drink water from anywhere.\" We can be in the exact same place, looking at the exact same thing, but see that thing in a completely different way. You can go around the world, and go to all the beautiful places, but never be happy, because happiness is something that you bring inside of you, it is not where you are or what you are looking at, but it is how you are and how you look at.\\nLove me like Saturday night, like three glasses of champagne, like the room is spinning, like you\\'re drunk on my love.\\nA dim vastness is spread before our souls; the perceptions of our mind are as obscure as those of our vision...

If you are happy for a reason, youâ\\x80\\x99re in trouble, because that reason can be taken from you.\\nTo be happy--one must find one\\'s bliss\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve come to think that flourishing consists of putting yourself in situations in which you lose self-consciousness and become fused with other people, experiences, or tasks. It happens sometimes when you are lost in a hard challenge, or when an artist or a craftsman becomes one with the brush or the tool. It happens sometimes while youâ\\x80\\x99re playing sports, or listening to music or lost in a story, or to some people when they feel enveloped by Godâ\\x80\\x99s love. And it happens most when we connect with other people. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve come to think that happiness isnâ\\x80\\x99t really produced by conscious accomplishments.

Do not fear being misunderstood and do not waste a minute thinking about your enemies. Try to fix firmly in your mind what you would like to do; and then, without veering off direction, you will move straight to the goal. Keep your mind on the great and splendid things you would like to do, and then, as the days go gliding away, you will find yourself unconsciously seizing upon the opportunities that are requiered for the fulfillment of your desire, just as the coral insect takes from the running tide the element it needs. Picture in your mind the able, earnest, useful person you desire to be, and the thought you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual... Thought is supreme. Preserve a right mental attitude - the attitude of courage, frankness, and good cheer. To think rightly is to create. All things come through desire and every sincere prayer is answered. We become like that on which our hearts are fixed. Carry your chin in and the crown of your head high.

The enjoyment of him is our proper; and is the only happiness with which our souls can be satisfied. To go to heaven, fully to enjoy God, is infinitely better than the most pleasant accommodations here. Better than fathers and mothers, husbands, wives, or children, or the company of any, or all earthly friends. These are but shadows; but the enjoyment of God is the substance. These are but scattered beams; but God is the sun. These are but streams; but God is the fountain.

I thought a lot about what I should write to you. I thought of giving you blessings and wishes for things of great value to happen to you in future; I thought of appreciating you for being the way you are; I thought to give sweet and lovely compliments for everything about you; I thought to write something in praise of your poems and prose; and I thought of extending my gratitude for being one of the very few sincerest friends I have ever had. But that is what all friends do and they only qualify to remain as a part of the bunch of our loosely connected memories and that\\'s not what I can choose to be, I cannot choose to be lost somewhere in your memories. So I thought of something through which I hope you will remember me for a very long time. I decided to share some part of my story, of what led me here, the part we both have had in common. A past, which changed us and our perception of the world. A past, which shaped our future into an unknown yet exciting opportunity to revisit the lost thoughts and to break free from the libido of our lost dreams. A past, which questioned our whole past. My dear, when the moment of my past struck me, in its highest demonised form, I felt dead, like a dead-man walking in flesh without a soul, who had no reason to live any more. I no longer saw any meaning of life but then I saw no reason to die as well. I travelled to far away lands, running away from friends, family and everyone else and I confined myself to my thoughts, to my feelings and to myself. Hours, days, weeks and months passed and I waited for a moment of magic to happen, a turn of destiny, but nothing happened, nothing ever happens. I waited and I counted each moment of it, thinking about every moment of my life, the good and the bad ones. I then saw how powerful yet weak, bright yet dark, beautiful yet ugly, joyous yet grievous; is a one single moment. One moment makes the difference. Just a one moment. Such appears to be the extreme and undisputed power of a single moment. We live in a world of appearance, Abigail, where the reality lies beyond the appearances, and this is also only what appears to be such powerful when in actuality it is not. I realised that the power of the moment is not in the moment itself. The power, actually, is in us. Every single one of us has the power to make and shape our own moments. It is us who by feeling joyful, celebrate for a moment of success; and it is also us who by feeling saddened, cry and mourn over our losses. I, with all my heart and mind, now embrace this power which lies within us. I wish life offers you more time to make use of this power. Remember, we are our own griefs, my dear, we are our own happinesses and we are our own remedies.\\nSky is not a limit for me; because I have no limit for myself in life. Because life is a world full of risk taking and possibilities.

Connective tissue.\\nso many thoughts, my kvothe. you know too much to be happy.\\nHappiness is having the freedom to do what you love.\\nAnd he, like many jaded people, had few pleasures left in life save good food and drink.\\nJ\\'ai connu et je connais encore, dans ma vie, des bonheurs inouÃ¯s. Depuis mon enfance, par exemple, j\\'ai toujours aimÃ© les concombres salÃ©s, pas les cornichons, mais les concombres, les vrais, les seuls et uniques, ceux qu\\'on appelle concombres Ã  la russe. J\\'en ai toujours trouvÃ© partout. Souvent, je m\\'en achÃ¨te une livre, je m\\'installe quelque part au soleil, au bord de la mer, ou n\\'importe oÃ¹, sur un trottoir ou sur un banc, je mords dans mon concombre et me voilÃ  complÃ¨tement heureux. Je reste lÃ , au soleil, le coeur apaisÃ©, en regardant les choses et les hommes d\\'un Å\\x93il amical et je sais que la vie vaut vraiment la peine d\\'Ãªtre vÃ©cue, que le bonheur est accessible, qu\\'il suffit simplement de trouver sa vocation profonde, et de se donner Ã  ce qu\\'on aime avec un abandon total de soi.\\n\"Mom, Arnie Welsh keeps calling me a geek. He says it like it\\'s a bad thing. Is being a geek a bad thing?\"\\nStraight lines go too quickly to appreciate the pleasures of the journey. They rush straight to their target and then die in the very moment of their triumph without having thought, loved, suffered or enjoyed themselves. Broken lines do not know what they want. With their caprices they cut time up, abuse routes, slash the joyous flowers and split the peaceful fruits with their corners. It is another story with curved lines. The song of the curved line is called happiness.\\nGod wants to rescue us, not destroy us. You don\\'t have to be afraid of being happy, thinking that he wants to take that happiness away from you That\\'s not who he is.\" \"How can you be sure?\" \"Because when you\\'ve had a taste of goodness, it helps you recognize the difference between good and evil. I believe that people like Grace and St. Francis and a whole host of other kind, loving people show us what God is like. He isn\\'t waiting to punish you and he doesn\\'t give you blessings just to strip them away.\\nHappiness was never important. The problem is that we don\\'t know what we really want. What makes us happy is not to get what we want. But to dream about it. Happiness is for opportunists. So I think that the only life of deep satisfaction is a life of eternal struggle, especially struggle with oneself. If you want to remain happy, just remain stupid. Authentic masters are never happy; happiness is a category of slaves.\\nThe only real battle in life is between hanging on and letting go.\\nThe tragedy of this world is that no one is happy, whether stuck in a time of pain or joy.\\nAction may not always bring happiness; but there is no happiness without action.\\nMuch of what we called \"depression\" was really dissatisfaction, a result of setting a bar impossibly high or expecting treasures we weren\\'t willing to work for.\\nI earnestly wish to point out in what true dignity and human happiness consists. I wish to persuade women to endeavor to acquire strength, both of mind and body, and to convince them that the soft phrases, susceptibility of heart, delicacy of sentiment, and refinement of taste, are almost synonymous with epithets of weakness, and that those beings are only the objects of pity, and that kind of love which has been termed its sister, will soon become objects of contempt.\\nStay away from conflictive, negative people that pull you down, because they contaminate your energy and impede your progress.

( \"Happy days are back again\" )\\nThe Smartphone has become a young divine embodying the ultimate desire and saving us from droopiness or lack of care and concern. It is the epitome of happiness, encompassing pleasure and contentment, but for sure does not allow woe and depression.

And it isnâ\\x80\\x99t that you lack competence. You just lack courage. One might say you are lacking in the courage to be happy.\\nNot all boats which sail into darkness never find the sun again, or the hand of another child; if life teaches anything at all, it teaches that there are so many happy endings that man who believes there is no God needs his rationality called into serious question.\\nSometimes we assume that the new person in our life is better for us because they are totally different from the last person we dated. Only later do we see that we have chosen a different version of the same thing and they both leave us unsatisfied.\\nWhen he looks at me, the way he looks at me... He does not know, what I lack... Or - how - I am incomplete. He sees me, for what I - am, as I am. He\\'s happy - to see me. Every time. Every day.\\nMaybe this is a characteristic of happy people.

If you knew for certain that you had a terminal illness - if you had precious little time left to make use of your life and consider who you are, you\\'d not waste time on self-indulgence or fear, lethargy or ambition. Be happy now, without reason - or you never will be at all.\\nThere are more people who wish to be loved than there are who are willing to love.\\nSweetheart, happily ever after does exist, itâ\\x80\\x99s just not what you think, he said. Happily ever after isnâ\\x80\\x99t a solution to lifeâ\\x80\\x99s problems or a guarantee that life will be easy; itâ\\x80\\x99s a promise we make ourselves to always live our best lives, despite whatever circumstance comes our way. When we focus on joy in times of heartbreak, when we choose to laugh on the days itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to smile, and when we count our blessings over our lossesâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s what a true happily ever after is all about. You donâ\\x80\\x99t get there by being perfect; on the contrary, itâ\\x80\\x99s our humanity that guides us. And thatâ\\x80\\x99s what fairy tales have been trying to teach us all along.\\nHappiness is something you lay siege to, it is a battle like a game of go. I will take hold of all the pain and snuff it out.\\nI don\\'t have a diary, I don\\'t write things into a diary. I imprint myself into the sky and when the sunlight shines brightly, I can stand under the sun\\'s rays and everything I have imprinted of myself into the sky, I will begin to see again, feel again, remember.

I am not content with being happy. I was not made for it. It is not my destiny. My destiny is the opposite.\\nMy request today is simple. Today. Tomorrow. Next week. Find somebody, anybody, thatâ\\x80\\x99s different than you. Somebody that has made you feel ill-will or even hateful. Somebody whose life decisions have made you uncomfortable. Somebody who practices a different religion than you do. Somebody who has been lost to addiction. Somebody with a criminal past. Somebody who dresses below you. Somebody with disabilities. Somebody who lives an alternative lifestyle. Somebody without a home.\\nTrue happiness, we are told, consists in getting out of one\\'s self; but the point is not only to get out - you must stay out; and to stay out you must have some absorbing errand.\\nRemember, happiness doesn\\'t depend upon who you are or what you have; it depends solely upon what you think. So start each day by thinking of all the things you have to be thankful for. Your future will depend very largely on the thoughts you think today. So think thoughts of hope and confidence and love and success.\\nMonsters donâ\\x80\\x99t get happy endings.\\nand we laugh and laugh and\\nHappily Single\" is recognizing that you donâ\\x80\\x99t need or want to be rescued from your life by a handsome prince because your life is pretty awesome, as is.\\nToo often being happy means being passive or playing it safe. There\\'s no skill required in happiness, no strength of character, nothing extraordinary. Its discontent that drives creation the most--passion, desire, defiance. Revolutions don\\'t come from a place of happiness. If anything, I think it\\'s sadness, or discontent at least, that\\'s at the root of everything beautiful.\\nHappiness comes from righteous living and the development of a noble character. You can observe this by noticing that people who are truly happy are honest, unselfish, kind, responsible and have a high moral standards. On the other hand, unhappy people are invariably selfish, lazy, irresponsible and lacking of self discipline. And people who are miserable tend to be immoral, dishonest, greedy, cruel, or in other ways dark in character. \\nIf you want to be happy, do not dwell in the past, do not worry about the future, focus on living fully in the present.\\nYou donâ\\x80\\x99t have to be happy to smile.\\nThere is something beautiful about watching two people lovingly act silly together; behaving as though no one else existed.\\nWhen you win and the other fellow loses, what do you see?

The one who brings happiness to others.\\nmy child, if you want to have a beautiful and happy life... 2 things you need... learn the art of love and practice it with your beloved one.\\nThe trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. This is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain. If you canâ\\x80\\x99t lick â\\x80\\x98em, join â\\x80\\x98em. If it hurts, repeat it. But to praise despair is to condemn delight, to embrace violence is to lose hold of everything else. We have almost lost hold; we can no longer describe a happy man, nor make any celebration of joy.\\nYou know what my father told me when I was little, one day, when he found me crying? He told me that God gave people a fixed number of tears and are of two kinds: tears of sadness and tears of happiness. And that I should not waste my tears elsewhere, but keep them for the moments of happiness. Would be a shame to not have tears to cry then ... \\nWe never realize just how many other lives we can help when their paths cross our own.\\nHappiness\" describes moments, and it\\'s never permanent.\\nEveryone who is not happy must be shot.\\nHappy is the soul that has a friend.

Each of us has three different people living inside us every dayâ\\x80\\x94who you were, who you are and who you will become. The road to sanity is to recognize those identities, in order to know who you are today.\\nLas cosas mÃ¡s tristes son las que deberÃ¬an ser felices y no lo son.\\nWhen, therefore, we maintain that pleasure is the end, we do not mean the pleasures of profligates and those that consist in sensuality, as is supposed by some who are either ignorant or disagree with us or do not understand, but freedom from pain in the body and from trouble in the mind. For it is not continuous drinkings and revelings, nor the satisfaction of lusts, nor the enjoyment of fish and other luxuries of the wealthy table, which produce a pleasant life, but sober reasoning, searching out the motives for all choice and avoidance, and banishing mere opinions, to which are due the greatest disturbance of the spirit.\\nOur possibilities of happiness are already restricted by our constitution. Unhappiness is much less difficult to experience. We are threatened with suffering from three directions: from our own body, which is doomed to decay and dissolution and which cannot even do without pain and anxiety as warning signals; from the external world, which may rage against us with overwhelming and merciless forces of destruction; and finally from our relations to other men. The suffering which comes from this last source is perhaps more painful to us than any other.\\nIf one\\'s bowels move, one is happy, and if they don\\'t move, one is unhappy. That is all there is to it.\\nAnd although it might be best of all to be Socrates satisfied, having both happiness and depth, we would give up some happiness in order to gain the depth.\\nThe essence of philosophy is that a man should so live that his happiness shall depend as little as possible on external things.\\nYou are forgiven for your happiness and your successes only if you generously consent to share them.\\nIf you always attach positive emotions to the things you want, and never attach negative emotions to the things you don\\'t, then that which you desire most will invariably come your way.\\nInsecurities have the ability to shape and mold our minds to live with everything thatâ\\x80\\x99s bad; like crying on the inside, while smiling on the outsideâ\\x80¦thus creating painâ\\x80¦but, alas, I have the answer; forget about what you thought and enjoy (embrace) what you feel\\nTalking about someone who makes you happy actually makes you happy.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99d rather be miserable loving you than happy with anyone else.\\nHe went to the church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people hurrying to and for, and patted the children on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into the kitchens of homes, and up to the windows, and found that everything could yield him pleasure. He had never dreamed of any walk, that anything, could give him so much happiness. (p. 119)\\nTo like many people spontaneously and without effort is perhaps the greatest of all sources of personal happiness.\\nAnd for a momentâ\\x80\\x95for a split secondâ\\x80\\x95everything else falls away, the whole pattern and order of my life, and a huge joy crests in my chest. I am no one, and I owe nothing to anybody, and my life is my own.\\nSometimes when you\\'re young, you have moments of such happiness, you think you\\'re living on someplace magical, like Atlantis must have been. Then we grow up and our hearts break into two.\\nMost people think, when they\\'re young, that they\\'re going to the top of their chosen world, and that the climb up is only a formality. Without that faith, I suppose, they might never start. Somewhere on the way they lift their eyes to the summit and know they aren\\'t going to reach it; and happiness then is looking down and enjoying the view they\\'ve got, not envying the one they haven\\'t.\\nMay those who follow their fate be granted happiness; may those who defy it be granted glory\\nBecause I was more often happy for other people, I got to spend more time being happy. And as I saw more light in everybody else, I seemed to have more myself. (250)\\nYou are beautiful. Your beauty, just like your capacity for life, happiness, and success, is immeasurable.\\nPerhaps some people really are born unhappy. I surely hope not. Speaking for my sister and myself: We were born with the capacity and determination to be utterly happy all the time. Perhaps even in this we were freaks. Hi ho.\\nFree yourself from the complexities of your life! A life of simplicity and happiness awaits you.\\nWe have everything we need to be happy, but we aren\\'t happy. Something\\'s missing.\\nWe are young, but We already know that in life\\'s great game those who are most unhappy are those who haven\\'t taken the risk to be happy. \\nHappiness must be grown in one\\'s own garden. \\nA life of happiness, peace, and love is all within our grasp.\\nHappiness is what you choose, what you follow, not what follows you.

Taking a risk to be happy, that takes guts.\\nThe ways of happiness and meaning are not the same. To find happiness, a man need only live in the moment; he need only live for the moment. But if he wants meaningâ\\x80\\x94the meaning of his dreams, his secrets, his lifeâ\\x80\\x94a man must reinhabit his past, however dark, and live for the future, however uncertain. Thus nature dangles happiness and meaning before us all, insisting only that we choose between them.\\nWeâ\\x80\\x99re young, weâ\\x80\\x99re not monsters, no fools: weâ\\x80\\x99ll conquer happiness for ourselves.\\nWell,â\\x80\\x99 you may ask, â\\x80\\x98how may I know when I am in love?â\\x80\\x99\\nIf we live our lives looking for the excitement and exhilaration that change can bring, we will be much happier than when we are eventually forced to accept it anyways.\\nHappiness is the pleasantest of emotions; because of this, it is the most dangerous.

The anticipation of dinner and a book. The dinner is by now forgotten; Lessing has been long overshadowed by other writers. What lives undimmed in Clarissa\\'s mind more than three decades later is a kiss at dusk on a patch of dead grass, and a walk around a pond as mosquitoes droned in the darkening air.

It is a warm glow of the heart at peace with itself. A martyr at the stake may have happiness that a king on his throne might envy. Man is the creator of his own happiness.

For what a man has he may be dependent upon others; what he is rests with him alone.\\nOur life is like a land journey, too even and easy and dull over long distances across the plains, too hard and painful up the steep grades; but, on the summits of the mountain, you have a magnificent view--and feel exalted--and your eyes are full of happy tears--and you want to sing--and wish you had wings! And then--you can\\'t stay there, but must continue your journey--you begin climbing down the other side, so busy with your footholds that your summit experience is forgotten.\\nTo be happy you must have taken the measure of your powers, tasted the fruits of your passion, and learned your place in the world.\\nThere is nothing worse for the lying soul than the mirror of reality.\\nHow exquisitely human was the wish for permanent happiness, and how thin human imagination became trying to achieve it.\\nWhen we give freely, we feel full and complete; when we withhold, we feel small, petty, impotent, and lacking. We are meant to learn this great truth, that giving fulfills us, while withholding and trying to get causes us to feel empty and even more needy. This truth runs counter to our programming, which drives us to try to get something from others to fulfill our neediness, only to end up even more needy, grasping, lacking, and unfulfilled.\\nWhen a small child, I thought that success spelled happiness. I was wrong, happiness is like a butterfly which appears and delights us for one brief moment, but soon flits away. \\nHappiness doesn\\'t have to be chased...it merely has to be chosen.\\nIf you are a dreamer, come in,\\nWell, I am happy, and I won\\'t fret, but it does seem as if the more one gets the more one wantsâ\\x80¦\\nNourishing yourself in a way that helps you blossom in the direction you want to go is attainable, and you are worth the effort.\\nThe advance of regret can be so gradual that it is impossible to say \"yesterday I was happy, today I am not.\\nThe most detestable wickedness, the most horrid cruelties, and the greatest miseries, that have afflicted the human race have had their origin in this thing called revelation, or revealed religion. It has been the most dishonourable belief against the character of the divinity, the most destructive to morality, and the peace and happiness of man, that ever was propagated since man began to exist. It is better, far better, that we admitted, if it were possible, a thousand devils to roam at large, and to preach publicly the doctrine of devils, if there were any such, than that we permitted one such impostor and monster as Moses, Joshua, Samuel, and the Bible prophets, to come with the pretended word of God in his mouth, and have credit among us.\\nPeople, he thought, were as hungry for a sight of joy as he had always been--for a moment\\'s relief from that gray load of suffering which seemed so inexplicable and unnecessary. He had never been able to understand why men should be unhappy.\\nHelping others is the secret sauce to a happy life.\\nI am thankful when I am hungry because then I know that when I eat, the food will taste better. Life has taught me that my true contentment rests in hope, and the pleasure itself is secondary. It is self-awareness, not happiness, that maintains peace.\\nMake the most of every moment. Get excited about every little thing. Why not? Why not have your wonderful moment of excited anticipation? Why not be happy NOW?

The possibility it offers of displacing a large amount of libidinal components, whether narcissistic, aggressive or even erotic, on to professional work and on to the human relations connected with it lends it a value by no means second to what it enjoys as something indispensible to the preservation and justification of existence in society. Professional activity is a source of special satisfaction if it is a freely chosen one â\\x80\\x94 if, that is to say, by means of sublimation, it makes possible the use of existing inclinations, of persisting or constitutionally reinforced instinctual impulses. And yet, as a path to happiness, work is not highly prized by men. They do not strive after it as they do after other possibilities of satisfaction. The great majority of people only work under the stress of necessity, and this natural human aversion to work raises most difficult social problems.\\nMost of all, I\\'ll remind them each morning that we make a choice to bring positivity or negativity into the world, and that within every single person where lies an extraordinary story waiting to unfold.\\nSometimes I wish life was written pencil so we could erase it and write it all over again.\\nYou and your purpose in life are the same thing.

Not for the money. Not for the fame. Not for the recognition. But for the pure joy of creating something and sharing it.\\nThe best parts of life are the things we can\\'t plan. And it\\'s a lot harder to find happiness if you\\'re only searching in one place. Sometimes, you just have to throw away the map. Admit that you don\\'t know where you\\'re going and stop pressuring yourself to figure it out. Besides...a map is a life someone else already lived. It\\'s more fun to make your own.\\n...the face has limited space. My mother used to say, if you fill your face with laughing, there will be no more room for crying.\\nProbably the wisest words that were ever uttered to me. Came from a therapist. I was sitting in her office, crying my eyes out. . . and she said, \"So let me get this straight. You base your personal happiness on things entirely out of your control.\\nThe negation of severe suffering was the nearest approach to happiness I expected to know. Besides, I seemed to hold two lives - the life of thought, and that of reality.\\nAn important decision I made was to resist playing the Blame Game. The day I realized that I am in charge of how I will approach problems in my life, that things will turn out better or worse because of me and nobody else, that was the day I knew I would be a happier and healthier person. And that was the day I knew I could truly build a life that matters.\\nThe only horrible thing in the world is ennui.\\nTake responsibility for your own happiness, do not expect people or things to bring you happiness, or you could be disappointed.\\nJustice is the only worship.\\nWhen I saw you, I fell in love, and you smiled because you knew\\nStop wasting your time looking for the key to happinessâ\\x80¦ the door is open and unlockedâ\\x80¦ just walk through it.\\nThe media represents world that is more real than reality that we can experience. People lose the ability to distinguish between reality and fantasy. They also begin to engage with the fantasy without realizing what it really is. They seek happiness and fulfilment through the simulacra of reality, e.g. media and avoid the contact/interaction with the real world. (Note: This quote is fake and does not appear in Simulacra and Simulation. I tried to delete it, but the system doesn\\'t allow that because this quote has \"too many fans\" lol.)\\nLive your life, sing your song. Not full of expectations. Not for the ovations. But for the joy of it.\\nThe more honest you are, the more open, the less fear you will have, because there\\'s no anxiety about being exposed or revealed to others.\\nWhere happiness was not a possibility, the illusion of it was always more important.\\nLife isn\\'t all grand, but it isn\\'t all miserable either.  There\\'s both sweet and sour in every day.  So why focus on the ugly when you can gaze at what\\'s beautiful?  Concentrate on the good.\\nTo enlarge the sphere of social happiness is worthy of the benevolent design of a Masonic institution; and it is most fervently to be wished, that the conduct of every member of the fraternity, as well as those publications, that discover the principles which actuate them, may tend to convince mankind that the grand object of Masonry is to promote the happiness of the human race.\\nThe reasons we donâ\\x80\\x99t sleep at night are usually the same reasons we donâ\\x80\\x99t truly live during the day.\\nIf you want good luck; you must go out there and search for that luck!! Because luck is waiting for you to look for it.\\nHappiness is the lucky pane of glass you carry in your head. It takes all your cunning just to hang on to it, and once it\\'s smashed you have to move into a different sort of life.\\nYou are so intense. Like a storm.

The third one, though, told me to consult some verses from the Koran. [end quote]\\' ...I can see that he\\'s excited. [narrator]\\' ...Now I have many positive things to say about Coelho: He is respectable, inspiring as a man, a truth-seeker, and an appealing writer; but one should hesitate to call him a \\'literary\\' writer based on this quote. A \\'literary\\' author knows that a character\\'s excitement should be \\'shown\\' in his or her dialogue and not in the narrator\\'s commentary on it. Advice for Coelho: Remove the \\'I can see that he\\'s excited\\' sentence and show his excitement in the phrasing of his quote.(Now, in defense of Coelho, I am firmly of the opinion, having myself written plenty of prose that is flawed, that a novelist should be forgiven for slipping here and there.)Lastly, it appears that a belief in reincarnation is of great interest to Mr. Coelho ... Just think! He is a man who has achieved, (as Leonard Cohen would call it), \\'a remote human possibility.\\' He has won lots of fame and tons of money. And yet, how his preoccupation with reincarnationâ\\x80\\x94none other than an interest in being born again as somebody elseâ\\x80\\x94suggests that he is not happy!\\nNo happiness in the writer, no happiness in the reader.\\nMen spend their lives in anticipations,â\\x80\\x94in determining to be vastly happy at some period when they have time.

Life has its sad side, and we must take the rough with the smooth. Why, maids have died on their marriage eve, or, what\\'s worse, bringing their first baby into the world, and the world\\'s wagged on all the same. Life\\'s sad enough, in all conscience, but there\\'s nothing to be frightened about in it or to turn one\\'s stomach. I was country-bred, and as my old granny used to say, \"There\\'s no clock like the sun and no calendar like the stars.\" And why? Because it gets one used to the look of Time. There\\'s no bogey from over the hills that scares one like Time. But when one\\'s been used all one\\'s life to seeing him naked, as it were, instead of shut up in a clock, like he is in Lud, one learns that he is as quiet and peaceful as an old ox dragging the plough. And to watch Time teaches one to sing. They say the fruit from over the hills makes one sing. I\\'ve never tasted so much as a sherd of it, but for all that I can sing.\\nThere are lots of ways of being miserable, but thereâ\\x80\\x99s only one way of being comfortable, and that is to stop running round after happiness.

I\\'ve never been poverty-level poor (I mean, there\\'s been years where I\\'ve been officially beneath the poverty line, but that wasn\\'t poverty: that was being a student and living the Student Lifestyle), but I\\'ve been in a place where you know you can\\'t afford a better-quality food, where you can\\'t do certain things because of money, and I\\'d prefer not to have those problems if I can.

You fight for it, strive for it, insist upon it, and sometimes even travel around the world looking for it. You have to participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings. And once you have achieved a state of happiness, you must never become lax about maintaining it, you must make a mighty effort to keep swimming upward into that happiness forever, to stay afloat on top of it. If you donâ\\x80\\x99t, you will leak away your innate contentment.

I, alone with myself, was enjoying myself for the first time as with grandest company.\\nI was happy, but happy is an adult word. You don\\'t have to ask a child about happy, you see it. They are or they are not. Adults talk about being happy because largely they are not. Talking about it is the same as trying to catch the wind. Much easier to let it blow all over you. This is where I disagree with the philosophers. They talk about passionate things but there is no passion in them. Never talk happiness with a philosopher.\\nWe thought everything would be\\nAs Venus within Eros does not really aim at pleasure, so Eros does not aim at happiness. We may think he does, but when he is brought to the test it proves otherwise... For it is the very mark of Eros that when he is in us we had rather share unhappiness with the Beloved than be happy on any other terms.\\nDonâ\\x80\\x99t feel bad about feeling bad. Donâ\\x80\\x99t be frightened of feeling afraid. Donâ\\x80\\x99t be angry about getting angry. There is no need to give up when we are feeling depressed. Nor should we be dismayed at the grief which often accompanies the outgrowing of anything which needs outgrowing. We can be glad that our soul is speaking to us and pushing us onwards. We frequently need to persevere with a period of inner turmoil before the dust can settle and be swept out the door.\\nHappiness\\n(about William Blake)\\nSuffering sucks. Don\\'t do it.

Rather, happiness stems from loving ourselves and our lives exactly as they are, knowing that joy and pain, strength and weakness, glory and failure are all essential to the full human experience.\\nHappiness is simply a temporary condition that proceeds unhappiness. Fortunately for us, it works the other way around as well. But it\\'s all a part of the carnival, isn\\'t it?\\nIf she come, I be happy. If she don\\'t, I be content.

Happiness is not the satisfaction of whatever irrational wishes you might blindly attempt to indulge. Happiness is a state of non-contradictory joyâ\\x80\\x94a joy without penalty or guilt, a joy that does not clash with any of your values and does not work for your own destruction, not the joy of escaping from your mind, but of using your mind\\'s fullest power, not the joy of faking reality, but of achieving values that are real, not the joy of a drunkard, but of a producer. Happiness is possible only to a rational man, the man who desires nothing but rational goals, seeks nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions.\\nThree weeks ago, heâ\\x80\\x99d seen hail fall from the sky, only\\nA calm and modest life brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness.\\nThe bitterness of joy lies in the knowledge that it cannot last. Nor should joy last beyond a certain season, for, after that season, even joy would become merely habit.\\nWhen true happiness shows up, the ego is bored with it: It\\'s too plain, too ordinary, and it doesn\\'t leave us feeling special or above the fray. It doesn\\'t take away our problems, which is the ego\\'s idea of happiness. The ego wants no more difficulties: no ore sickness, no more need for money, no more work, no more bad feelings, only unending pleasure and bliss. Such perfection is the ego\\'s idea of a successful life. However, the happiness the ego dreams of will never be attained by anyone. The ego denies the reality of this dimension, where challenges are necessary to evolution and blissful states and pleasure come and go.\\nThere is nothing around me but money, money, money.\\nI drink to the general joy oâ\\x80\\x99 the whole table.\" Macbeth\\nOnce your soul is awakened, you never return to the sleepwalking state of mind.

And so she waits for Winter\\'s warmth to touch her in streets of distant shore, in her own world of simple happiness.\\nTry to be happy within the context of the life we are actually living. Happiness is not a situation to be longed for or a convergence of lucky happenstance.

Rhythms. It is so easy, while trapped in just the one life, to imagine that times of sadness or tragedy or failure or fear are a result of that particular existence. That it is a by-product of living a certain way, rather than simply living. I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You canâ\\x80\\x99t have one without the other. Of course, they come in different degrees and quantities. But there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever. And imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life youâ\\x80\\x99re in.\\nHappiness when sustained too long in print can rightly be construed as sappiness...\\nHowever powerful our technology and complex our corporations, the most remarkable feature of the modern working world may in the end be internal, consisting in an aspect of our mentalities: in the widely held belief that our work should make us happy. All societies have had work at their centre; ours is the first to suggest that it could be something more than a punishment or a penance. Ours is the first to imply that we should seek to work even in the absence of a financial imperative.\\nPercebo que esse Ã© o meu ideal de felicidade. Estar junto sem medo de que alguma coisa ruim vÃ¡ acontecer a qualquer momento.\\nI wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t listen. I wanted everything to stay as it was. I was more afraid of the truth than the lie.

The walls of my prison crumbled and fell, the dungeon was flooded with light and all the bolts, and bars, and manacles became dust. I was no longer a servant, a serf or a slave. There was for me no master in all the wide world -- not even in infinite space. I was free -- free to think, to express my thoughts -- free to live to my own ideal -- free to live for myself and those I loved -- free to use all my faculties, all my senses -- free to spread imagination\\'s wings -- free to investigate, to guess and dream and hope -- free to judge and determine for myself -- free to reject all ignorant and cruel creeds, all the \"inspired\" books that savages have produced, and all the barbarous legends of the past -- free from popes and priests -- free from all the \"called\" and \"set apart\" -- free from sanctified mistakes and holy lies -- free from the fear of eternal pain -- free from the winged monsters of the night -- free from devils, ghosts and gods. For the first time I was free. There were no prohibited places in all the realms of thought -- no air, no space, where fancy could not spread her painted wings -- no chains for my limbs -- no lashes for my back -- no fires for my flesh -- no master\\'s frown or threat â\\x80\\x93 no following another\\'s steps -- no need to bow, or cringe, or crawl, or utter lying words. I was free. I stood erect and fearlessly, joyously, faced all worlds.\\nIt\\'s not strength, it\\'s PERCEPTION that makes you stronger.

In fact, psychologist Daniel Gilbert has made a career out of demonstrating that human beings are downright awful at predicting their own likes and dislikes. For example, most research subjects strongly believe that another $30,000 a year in income would make them much happier. And they feel equally strongly that adding a 30-minute walk to their daily routine would be of trivial import. And yet Dr. Gilbertâ\\x80\\x99s research suggests that the added income is far less likely to produce an increase in happiness than the addition of a regular walk.\\nAccording to the Buddha, the failure to recognize the illusion of the self is the source of all ignorance and unhappiness. It is only by renouncing the self, that is, by dropping his ego defences and committing metaphorical suicide, that a person can open up to different modes of being and relating and thereby transform himself into a pure essence of humanity. In so doing, he becomes free to recast himself as a much more joyful and productive person, and attains the only species of transcendence and immortality that is open to man.\\nWhat\\'s simple is that everything good comes from God, and everything bad comes from man. Where it gets complicated is that everything seemingly good but ultimately bad comes from man, and everything seemingly bad but ultimately good comes from God.\\nLike love, like talent, like any other virtue, like anything else in this life, happiness needs to be nurtured - this is the truth of the whole matter.\\nLet food be thy your medicine\\nThe main objects of all science, the freedom and happiness of man. . . .

I haven\\'t got it yet, but I can sense it out there. I feel I\\'m close to it. Some days, I\\'m so close I can almost smell it.\\nMaybe happiness too is a metaphor invented on a day of boredom\\nThere are very few things in the mind which eat up as much energy as worry. It is one of the most difficult things not to worry about anything. Worry is experienced when things go wrong, but in relation to past happenings it is idle merely to wish that they might have been otherwise. The frozen past is what it is, and no amount of worrying is going to make it other than what it has been. But the limited ego-mind identifies itself with its past, gets entangled with it and keeps alive the pangs of frustrated desires. Thus worry continues to grow into the mental life of man until the ego-mind is burdened by the past. Worry is also experienced in relation to the future when this future is expected to be disagreeable in some way. In this case it seeks to justify itself as a necessary part of the attempt to prepare for coping with the anticipated situations. But, things can never be helped merely by worrying. Besides, many of the things which are anticipated never turn up, or if they do occur, they turn out to be much more acceptable than they were expected to be. Worry is the product of feverish imagination working under the stimulus of desires. It is a living through of sufferings which are mostly our own creation. Worry has never done anyone any good, and it is very much worse than mere dissipation of psychic energy, for it substantially curtails the joy and fullness of life.\\nLife is a useless passion, an exciting journey of a mammal in survival mode. Each day is a miracle, a blessing unexplored and the more you immerse yourself in light, the less you will feel the darkness. There is more to life than nothingness. And cynicism. And nihilism. And selfishness. And glorious isolation. Be selfish with yourself, but live your life through your immortal acts, acts that engrain your legacy onto humanity.

To put our arm around someone who is gay, someone who has an addiction, somebody who lives a different lifestyle, someone who is not what we think they should beâ\\x80¦ doing that has nothing to do with enabling them or accepting what they do as okay by us.

Happy times are great, but happy times pass- they have to- because time passes. The pursuit of happiness is more elusive; it is life-long, and it is not goal-centred. What you are pursuing is meaning- a meaningful life... There are times when it will go so wrong that you will be barely alive, and times when you realise that being barely alive, on your own terms, is better than living a bloated half-life on someone else\\'s terms.\\nWanna be always Happy?

The happiness of a married man depends on the people he has not married. One should always be in love - that\\'s the reason one should never marry.\\nOutside, she thought that there ought to be a word for it: the air temperature that was perfectly neither hot nor cold. One degree lower, and she might have felt a faint misgiving about not having brought a jacket. One degree higher, and a skim of sweat might have glistened at her hairline. But at this precise degree, she required neither wrap nor breeze. Were there a word for such a temperature, there would have to be a corollary for the particular ecstasy of greeting it - the heedlessness, the needlessness, the suspended lack of urgency, as if time could stop, or should. Usually temperature was a battle; only at this exact fulcrum was it an active delight.\\nFate is the malevolent little jester sitting up in the heavens and pondering over how ridiculous we humans are and he does his best to make fools out of all of us. And sooner or later he succeeds.\\nAnd though I was currently living a fairy tale, some part of my soul knew that happiness couldn\\'t last forever. I didn\\'t deserve a happily ever after, and there weren\\'t many other cards to play when that was the truth.\\nSome nonreligious people are disgruntled by the word \"faith,\" feeling that it has no connection to them. But we all have faith. Broadly speaking, \"faith\" does not apply only to belief in the supernatural.

To garden well is to be happy amid the babble of the objective world, untroubled by its refusal to be reduced by our ideas of it, its indomitable rankness.\\nRemember that our Heavenly Father knows us perfectly and knows what\\'s best for us . . . . Surely, His knowledge is greater than ours. We just have to have faith in Him. If we don\\'t, well, that doesn\\'t change what happened, it just makes us more miserable because we refuse to trust His will. Our Heavenly Father wants us to have joy. And happiness.

His father had died in January; it was only the end of May. They needed to stick to the routine they\\'d established during the intervening months. in that way, their life would return to its original shape, like a spring stretched in bad times but contracting eventually into happiness. That the world could come permanently unsprung had never occurred to him.\\n..Such practices and beliefs, which interfere with happiness, are neither inevitable nor necessary; they evolved by chance, as a result of random responses to accidental conditions. But once they become part of the norms and habits of a culture, people assume that this is how things must be; they come to believe they have no other options.\\nMankind were intended to be happy... that government being only the means of securing freedom and happiness to the people, whenever it deviates from this end, and their freedom and happiness are in great danger of being irrevocably lost, the government is no longer entitled to their allegiance.

I get intense and angry, accumulating layers around my essential needs, covering up my passions. These layers cover up my marks and scars, wounds and weary heart and I want it to show because sometimes I feel my only purpose here is to say: keep going, youâ\\x80\\x99re doing just fine.

You can be happy when married with children, or when married without children. You can be happy when you are single, without a college degree, or with one. You can be happy when you are slim, you can be happy when you are overweight. You can be happy when living in a warm climate as in California, you can be happy when living in Montana, where you have severe winter conditions. As a sumo wrestler, you can be happy when you make it to yokozuna, or you can be happy while remaining one of the underdogs all your career, doing small chores, never giving up.\\nThose who love you are not fooled by mistakes you have made or dark images you hold about yourself. They remember your beauty when you feel ugly; your wholeness when you are broken; your innocence when you feel guilty; and your purpose when you are confused.\\nI feel as though the world is a friendly boy walking along in the sun.\\nWe mistakenly think that by putting ourselves first, weâ\\x80\\x99ll finally get what we want. In fact, true happiness comes not from thinking more of ourselves, but rather from thinking less of ourselvesâ\\x80\\x94from seeing the truly small role we play in something much bigger, much more important than our individual needs.\\nI went back to my room and spent all night contemplating whether it was possible in life not to be constantly let down. If it could ever be worth pinning your happiness to another person, when all other people ever seemed to do was disappear.\\nI think one of the keys to happiness is accepting that I am never going to be perfectly happy. Life is uncomfortable. So I might as well get busy loving the people around me... I\\'m going to quit chasing happiness long enough to notice it smiling right at me.\\nThe ethereal past had blinded him, and the highest happiness he could dream was a return to it.\\nI\\'m telling you.

That people almost always become what they are labeled? Was whatever your child just did really the dumbest thing youâ\\x80\\x99ve ever seen somebody do? Was it really the most ridiculous thing they ever could have done? Do you really believe that your child is an idiot? Because she now does. Think about that. Because you said it, she now believes it. Bravo.\\nThey couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have known that even this was a lieâ\\x80\\x94that we never really choose, not entirely. We are always being pushed and squeezed down one road or another.

Itâ\\x80\\x99s time to take joy in their quirks and their ticks. Itâ\\x80\\x99s time to take joy in their facial expressions and their mispronounced words.

That\\'s all there is to it.\\nPain may be the only reality but if mankind had any sense it would pursue the delusion called happiness. All the philosophers and poets who tell us that pain and suffering have a place and purpose in the cosmic order of things are welcome to them. They are frauds. We justify pain because we do not know what to make of it, nor do we have any choice but to bear it. Happiness alone can make us momentarily larger than ourselves.\\nBut there was, she knew, something else. Happiness, she supposed. Whatever that might be. What, exactly, she wondered, was happiness. Very positively she wanted it.\\nNever let the things you want make you forget the things you have.\\nTry not to be self-conscious [â\\x80¦] or so critical.

Because he is entirely happy, he needs nothing. Because he needs nothing, he is entirely happy.\\nAt any given moment, your circumstances can change. You may not be where you want to be right now. You may not even be doing what you prefer to do. But, if you change your way of thinking and realize that you have all the opportunities available to you just like each one of us. You can begin to focus on what you want to achieve and make it happen\\nFor there to be harmony and peace, everything must be balanced. And for there to be balance, there must be equality. And where there is equality, there will be justice. And where justice is honored and preserved, there will always be truth. Eliminate the concept of division by class, skills, race, income, and nationality. We are all equals with a common pulse to survive. Every human requires food and water. Every human has a dream and desire to be happy. Every human responds to love, suffering and pain. Every human bleeds the same color and occupies the same world. Let us recognize that we are all part of each other. We are all human. We are all one.\\nEntertainment is temporary happiness, but the real happiness is permanent entertainment.\\nHealth is hearty, health is harmony, health is happiness.\\nTo sense the peace of extinguished passion\\nLove is my inner strength and my power.\\nIn Zen, there is an old saying: The obstacle is the path. Know that a whole and happy life is not free of obstacles. Quite the contrary, a whole and happy life is riddled with obstacles-they simply become the very stepping-stones that help lift us to a new perspective. It is not what happens to us in this life that shapes us, it is how we choose to respond to what happens to us.\\nSome people are like a thermometer. If their environment is negative, they are negative. If bad things happen, they are sad. If good things happen, they are happy. They are simply a product of their environment. Successful people, on the other hand, are more like a thermostat. Even if their environment is negative, they choose to be positive.\\nJealous of the crazy gay kid.

The dress, deep shimmering purple and utterly simple in design, was so beautifully-cut and so clingy and well-fitting that Fire felt slightly naked. And her hair. She couldnâ\\x80\\x99t follow what theyâ\\x80\\x99d done with her hair, braids thin as threads in some places, looped and wound through the thick sections that fell over her shoulders and down her back, but she saw that the end result was a controlled wildness that was magnificent against her face, her body, and the dress. She turned to measure the effect on her guard - all twenty of them, for all had roles to play in tonightâ\\x80\\x99s proceedings, and all were awaiting her orders. Twenty jaws hung slack with astonishment - even Musaâ\\x80\\x99s, Milaâ\\x80\\x99s, and Neelâ\\x80\\x99s.

Look well therefore to this day.\\nIt is anticipation and recollection that fill the heartâ\\x80\\x94never the sensation of the moment.\\nI absolutely think that happiness is a choice. One of the most potent forces in human psychology is the power of habit. Do something, think something, often enough and it will become the only thing you can do or think. Choose to be unhappy and soon thatâ\\x80\\x99s all you will be. Live in a swamp and youâ\\x80\\x99ll grow webbed feet.\\nTo be happy, make others happy.\\nâ\\x80¦I realized my happiness was artificial.

Not that he holds himself aloof, for indeed he is in harmony with everything and everyone; everything is \"in him\"; nothing can happen to him. The same may also be said for the contemplative person; he needs himself alone; he lacks nothing.\\nThere are some delightful places in this world which have a sensual charm for the eyes. One loves them with a physical love. We people who are attracted by the countryside cherish fond memories of certain springs, certain woods, certain ponds, certain hills, which have become familiar sights and can touch our hearts like happy events.\\nThere were happy days, with watermelon, and sad days of whiskey.\\nI\\'m not in pursuit of happiness, I\\'m happiness in pursuit; ready to happen everywhere I go.\\nMany people think that happiness comes from having more power or more money.\\nWhen I was a boy, I naively thought that this thing called happiness would be something I would wake up to find every day once I could smoke, drink and fornicate.\\nThe happy life does not mean loving what we possess, but possessing what we love.\" Possession of the beloved, St. Thomas holds, takes place in an act of cognition, in seeing, in intuition, in contemplation.\\nThe ultimate meaning of the active life is to make possible the happiness of contemplation.\\nYou cannot be buried in obscurity: you are exposed upon a grand theater to the view of the world. If your actions are upright and benevolent, be assured they will augment your power and happiness.\\nHe had learned that, as there is no situation in the world in which a man can be happy and perfectly free, so there is no situation in which he can be perfectly unhappy and unfree.\\nDo we take less pride in the possession of our home because its walls were built by some unknown carpenter, its tapestries woven by some unknown weaver on a far Oriental shore, in some antique time? No. We show our home to our friends with the pride as if it were our home, which it is. Why then should we take less pride when reading a book written by some long-dead author? Is it not our book just as much, or even more so, than theirs? So the landowner says, â\\x80\\x98Look at my beautiful home! Isnâ\\x80\\x99t it fine?â\\x80\\x99 And not, â\\x80\\x98Look at the home so-and-so has built.â\\x80\\x99 Thus we shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t cry, â\\x80\\x98Look what so-and-so has written. What a genius so-and-so is!â\\x80\\x99 But rather, â\\x80\\x98Look at what I have read! Am I not a genius? Have I not invented these pages? The walls of this universe, did I not build?

Decide what you want, create a plan, and get your ass out there!\\nNo one can obtain felicity by pursuit. This explains why one of the elements of being happy is the feeling that a debt of gratitude is owed, a debt impossible to pay. Now, we do not owe gratitude to ourselves. To be conscious of gratitude is to acknowledge a gift.\\nWe remember though all the firelit glow\\nWhen you let go of past pain, believe in yourself, and follow your dreamsâ\\x80\\x94you can find true happiness!\\n..there is more to life than just pleasure. We want to achieve our happiness and not just experience it.\\nI could hear the knock and whistle of the water pipes, the purr of the calico cat. And at that moment a happiness filled me that was pure and perfect and yet it was bled with despair - as if I had been handed a cup of ambrosial nectar to drink from and knew that once I finished drinking, the cup would be withdrawn forever, and nothing to come would ever taste as good.\\nâ\\x80¦Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy, than felt herself to be soâ\\x80¦\\nIdeas and philosophies have a shelf-life. They must be kept fresh and renewed or they will spoil. If left unattended, the same ideas and philosophies that once nourished you and helped you grow can poison you and make you sick. Become aware of new ideas that can refresh your way of life and be open to the fact that your old ideas and philosophies can work for you for some time, but when the shelf-life has passed, those ideas and philosophies could also harm you.\\nThe end of the creation is that God may communicate happiness to the creature\\nOur greatest happiness comes from the experience of love & compassion.\\nNÃ£o Ã© verdade que a felicidade Ã© aquilo que procuramos sem nunca sermos capazes de a reconhecer?\\nHappiness is a decision and so as Love. If you decide to be happy then you\\'re happy. If you decide to love then you love.\\nIf you think happiness is a rare bird you won\\'t see much of it.\\nMay I nurture the serenity to accept the things I cannot change the courage to change the things I can change and wisdom to know the difference\\nHappiness is something that you cannot see. It is naturally felt. When you feel it, you wouldn\\'t wanna let go of it. It makes you smile. It keeps you going. It gives you the energy that nothing and nobody can give. Ig pushes to do things that renders positive vibe inside.\\nSo in our own poor hides and from our miserable comrades we learn the nature of satiety. Satiety depends not at all on how much we eat, but on how we eat. It\\'s the same with happiness, the very same...happiness doesn\\'t depend on how many external blessings we have snatched from life. It depends only on our attitude toward them. There\\'s a saying about it in the Taoist ethic: \\'Whoever is capable of contentment will always be satisfied.\\nLet me implore the reader to try to believe, if only for a moment, that God, who made these deserving people, may really be right when He thinks that their modest prosperity and the happiness of their children are not enough to make them blessed: that all this must fall from them in the end, and if they have not learned to know Him they will be wretched. And therefore He troubles them, warning them in advance of an insufficiency that one day they will have to discover. The life to themselves and their families stands between them and the recognition of their need; He makes that life less sweet to them.\\nOriginal, in French: La bonne cuisine est la base du vÃ©ritable bonheur.\\nMan is here for the sake of other men - above all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness depends.\\nAnalyzing data from 79 men and women who wore inconspicuous devices that recorded some of their conversations over the course of four days, researchers from Washington University and the University of Arizona found a correlation between feelings of well-being and the amount of time spent talking every day. Moreover, the more substantive your conversations, the happier you\\'re likely to be. In other words, heart-to-hearts trump small talk. (LA Times, \"A lof of happy talk\", March 11, 2010, A21.)\\nNo man is happy without a delusion of some kind. Delusions are as necessary to our happiness as realities..\\nOnly a fool can be happy. For happiness consists of two contradictory elements: contentment and pleasure. Enjoy pleasure and you have no contentment; be content and you have no pleasure. For this reason happiness is conceivable only for those who enjoy themselves without thinking that they will always want more and thus be discontented, or for those who are content without thinking that they have no pleasure. Whoever reflects can never be happy, unless he is a fanatic and thus blindedâ\\x80¦thus exercising control over his intelligence with his feelings, instead of the other way round\\nHappiness is the change that comes over me\\nBeing happy is a great science. If you are not happy, do not be confused. Happiness is hard to achieve.\\nMy parents have been married forty-two years. I wonder how many of those were happy.\\nHe turned from the sight of human ignorance and human fate and the sea eating the ground we stand on, which, had he been able to contemplate it fixedly might have led to something; and found consolation in trifles so slight compared with the august theme just now before him that he was disposed to slur that comfort over, to deprecate it, as if to be caught happy in a world of misery was for an honest man the most despicable of crimes.\\nTimes of terror and the deepest misery may arrive, but if there is to be any happiness in this misery it can only be a spiritual happiness, related to the past in the rescue of the culture of early ages and to the future in a serene and indefatigable championship of the spirit in a time which would otherwise completely swallow up the material.\\nLa felicidad es una bendiciÃ³n, pero generalmente es tambiÃ©n una conquista.\\nIt might be true that it is quality time that counts, but after a certain point quantity has a bearing on quality.\\nHoliness leads to wholeness and wholeness leads to happiness.\\nPeople argue themselves out of their pleasures\\nThere is a preppy wabi-sabi to soft, faded khakis and cotton shirts, but it\\'s not nice to be surrounded by things that are worn out or stained or used up.\\nWe each sell alittle piece of happiness. You are elevating someone\\'s spirit in some way, and to do that you have to understand the source of their angst and then you have to frame your product as a solution.\\nA sense of peace came over me and I must have been smiling as I fell asleep.\\nMoney is time. With money I buy for cheerful use the hours which otherwise would not in any sense be mine; nay, which would make me their miserable bondsman.\\nHealth, wealth, happiness,\\nIt is not the rich man you should properly call happy,\\nIt has been observed in all ages that the advantages of nature or of fortune have contributed very little to the promotion of happiness; and that those whom the splendour of their rank, or the extent of their capacity, have placed upon the summits of human life, have not often given any just occasion to envy in those who look up to them from a lower station; whether it be that apparent superiority incites great designs, and great designs are naturally liable to fatal miscarriages; or that the general lot of mankind is misery, and the misfortunes of those whose eminence drew upon them an universal attention, have been more carefully recorded, because they were more generally observed, and have in reality only been more conspicuous than others, not more frequent, or more severe.\\nFind happiness where you can,\" she said softly. \"It\\'s not just the great big whammo things. Look for the beauty of life in the small things, and you\\'ll be the happiest person alive.\\nThe golden rule of business is supply and demand. I venture to say that this is also the rule of happiness. When a balance is achieved between our desires and another\\'s willingness to satisfy them, the result is a sympathetic, mutually rewarding relationship. (...) a thriving economy of love.\\' - character Mike Lambeth\\nI am happy and content because I think I am.\\nThe glitter of the great world, you know, is only so much froth and spume: you may look in vain for happiness there.\\nEach to their own reality\\nDon\\'t look to a husband or a child or a friend or your family to make you happy. It is not within their capacity to do so.\\nâ\\x80¦feeling as if all the happiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them.\\nManners and politeness will never become old-fashioned.\\nExpectation has brought me disappointment. Disappointment has brought me wisdom. Acceptance, gratitude and appreciation have brought me joy and fulfilment.\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s the â\\x80\\x98everydayâ\\x80\\x99 experiences we encounter along the journey to who we wanna be that will define who we are when we get there.\\nWhen I count my blessings, I find you in every one.\\nDaily dance uplift the soul to spiritual realms.\\nMost sane human beingsâ\\x80\\x99 chances of being alive in a thousand yearsâ\\x80\\x99 time are a hundred times higher than their chances of being sincerely happy for at least ten consecutive days.\\nLife always gives us another change: It\\'s called \"To Move On\".\\n...the Puritans compressed whatever mirth and public joy they deemed allowable to human infirmity; thereby so far dispelling the customary cloud, that, for the space of a single holiday, they appeared scarcely more grave than most other communities at a period of general affliction.\\nIt is difficult to live in and enjoy the moment when you are thinking about the past or worrying about the future.\\nYour words, thoughts, intentions and actions today are your best hope, comfort, building blocks and insurance for tomorrow. But it is now alone that is guaranteed â\\x80\\x93 tomorrow is a dream, a maybe a potential gift. Itâ\\x80\\x99s now - not tomorrow - where happiness and fulfilment live...awaiting your discovery. Itâ\\x80\\x99s all this that will make each extra day that may arrive extra special and rich.\\nThere are people who have no talent for happiness and who know this with painful, implacable clarity. Such people donâ\\x80\\x99t seek happiness, merely to bring some sort of form and style to their unhappiness.\\nShe doesn\\'t need your money. Even a penniless fool like you can make her fall in love with you. That\\'s just miracle.\\nI have dedicated my life to fight against the heinous rottenness of modern capitalism because it robs the laborer of this world\\'s goods. But blow for blow I shall strike against Communism, because it robs us of the next world\\'s happiness.\\nWhere else,\" I will say, \"does an old turtle crossing the path Make all the difference in the world?\\nIt\\'s always something here - if there isn\\'t a riot, then someone\\'s usually trying to escape. The wasted effort helps me see the positives of imprisonment. Unlike those pulling their hair out in good society, here we don\\'t have to feel ashamed of our day-to-day unhappiness. Here we have someone visible to blame - someone wearing shiny boots. That\\'s why, on consideration, freedom leaves me cold. Because out there in the real world, freedom means you have to admit authorship, even when your story turns out to be a real stinker.\\nTo be happy a woman had to think hard, during long silent hours, about how to make each small step forward.\\nSmile more. Smiling can make you and others happy.\\nKurzes GlÃ¼ck kann jeder.\\nSome fake happiness, some fake sadness and some fake an orgasm.\\nOh, God, if I\\'m anything by a clinical name, I\\'m a kind of paranoiac in reverse. I think people are plotting to make me happy.\\nTo lovers there.\\nWhen we are happy, we donâ\\x80\\x99t know that we are happy, because happiness requires childlike innocence. When a child is happy, he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t know that he is happy. He doesnâ\\x80\\x99t formulate it, he simply enjoys it.\\nyeah, sure, the sun will age my skin, and all these giggles and smiles with you will, over time, will crack up my face and give me wrinkles...sunshine, giggles, smiles, you? that\\'s happiness, baby i\\'m living!\\nIt was a community, and in Ibrahim\\'s opinion that was how human beings were designed to live. At Coopers Chase, anytime you wanted to be alone, you would simply close your front door, and anytime you wanted to be with people, you would open it up again. If there was a better recipe for happiness than that, then Ibrahim was yet to hear it.\\nI like the disaster of the night sky, stars spilling this way and that as if they were upturned from a glass. I like the way good madness feels. I like the way laughter always spills. That\\'s the word for it. It never just comes, it spills. I like the word \\'again\\'. Again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. I like the quiet sound a coffee cup makes when it\\'s set down on a wooden table. So hushed. So inviting. Like morning light yawning through the window and stretching out onto the kitchen floor. I like the way girls\\' lips look like they\\'re stained with berries. I like the way morning light breaks like a prism through the empty wine bottles on our dusty apartment floor. Glasses empty except for the midnight hour. I like the way blueberries stain my fingers during the summer. I like the way light hits your eyes and turns it into a color that doesn\\'t exist anywhere else other than in this moment. I want it all. I want the breeze to call my name as it rushes down my street, looking for me. I want to feel grass underneath my bare feet and I want to feel the sun kiss freckles onto my cheeks. I want to hear you yell hello as you make your way towards me, not goodbye as you have to go.\\nOther people are, as a rule, so immaterial to us that, when we have entrusted to any one of them the power to cause so much suffering or happiness to ourselves, that person seems at once to belong to a different universe, is surrounded with poetry, makes of our lives a vast expanse, quick with sensation, on which that person and ourselves are ever more or less in contact.\\nWe love with all our heart, in every way that we can love but the heart is not burdened. We learn to keep it light and pliable. It has space. It breathes. It waits on Life to give instructions. It sings with sweetness when the winds are soft and warm. It stands with calm patience when the storm is brewing. It lets go when death and seeming endings have left their irrefutable mark. It moves. It heals. It hopes. It allows Life to be lived in the safe, fertile, and still inner space where it grows stronger and more compelling every day.\\nI believe our clever young man has intuited that while only the pursuit of happiness is promised to all Americans, unhappiness is guaranteed for many.\\nI laugh as an unfamiliar feeling envelops me. I think it might be happiness.\\nThere is a moral imperative to seeing mental health through the same lens we use for other pathologies or illnesses. Being sad or overwhelmed is normal, much as being short of breath after a run is normal. Both become abnormal when they happen with no apparent cause and are hard to stop. Those situations need medical attention.\\nIf you have time to whine then you have time to find solution.\\nDon\\'t interpret anything too much. This is time waster number 1.\\nHow is it that from beauty I have derived a type of unloveliness?â\\x80\\x94from the covenant of peace a simile of sorrow? But as, in ethics, evil is a consequence of good, so, in fact, out of joy is sorrow born.\\nJoy weathers any storm: Happiness rides the waves.\\nHuge difference between being happy at will, and chasing euphoric moments as an escape. One doesn\\'t cost a dime, the other will tax your soul.\\nIf you walk in joy, happiness is close behind.\\nWE can learn to rejoice in even the smallest blessings our life holds. It is easy to miss our own good fortune; often happiness comes in ways we donâ\\x80\\x99t even notice.\\nCompromise brings harmony to both, happiness to none.\\nThere is nothing more powerful than truth. It is undeniable and should always be appreciated. The truth gives you unlimited freedom to be who you are and express how you feel. The truth offers you peace of mind which is something we all love.\\nTo fall in love for any reason does cause fires of emotion. When we are in love, we ride on a positive energy as compared to not being in love. When we are love, we transcend conditional love to that of unconditional and we are now flowering in consciousness. Love is a very important element of consciousness as it becomes purer with Source union even as our consciousness is expanded further. Consciousness is love that is light.\\nBe like the flower, content with its nature.\\nWe will be able to depart this life with the quiet peace-giving notion, that we were permitted to contribute to the happiness of many who will live after us. In our long lives we endeavored to unfold the collective consciousness. In our lives we have known hell and heaven; the final balance, however, is that we helped pave the way to dynamic harmony in this earthly house. That, I believe, is the meaning of life.\\nOne thing I\\'ve learned: we don\\'t stumble accidentally into an amazing life. It takes decision, a commitment to consistently work on ourselves.\\nYour happiness and suffering depend on your actions and not on my wishes for you.\\nHe should be happy because he can think about the unhappiness of others!\\nHappy people are those who use a lower threshold in order to label an event positive.\\nThe more people I meet the happier I become.\\nGive up smoking cold turkey. Start a diet in the next 5 min. Accept that job right away. Life can be beautiful without planning!\\nYou are the moon that breaks the night . You are the fear that I hate to fight. Times are wrong in all that is done. My treasure is love that I give to only one. Cherrish the treasures given to your heart and never let anything hurt from the start. You chose your path so accept and believe, that peace love and light are needed to breathe.\\nBy making yourself a life-long leaner youâ\\x80\\x99ll keep discovering new and exciting things about yourself and others.\\nWe advocate the atheistic philosophy because it is the only clear, consistent position which seems possible to us. As atheists, we simply deny the assumptions of theism; we declare that the God idea, in all its features, is unreasonable and unprovable; we add, more vitally, that the God idea is an interference with the interests of human happiness and progress. We oppose religion not merely as a set of theological ideas; but we must also oppose religion as a political, social and moral influence detrimental to the welfare of humanity.\\n(...) La felicidad es tener un corazÃ³n capaz de amar. Es saber que has sido importante para alguien... Que de algÃºn modo, en algÃºn momento, has marcado la diferencia. Y la muerte no es nada en comparaciÃ³n con esos momentos.\\nHappiness is wanting what you have.\\nBetween natural ability and education choose natural ability, as it will keep you happy and will fetch you the glory sooner.\\nYour happiness is meaningless unless it is linked with the total liberation of people around you! You matter; others also matter! Live life so well!\\nThey all want to be happy. They all think they should be happy. And theyâ\\x80\\x99re quick to trot out their most cherished document and point to where they were promised life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. But youâ\\x80\\x99ll find that though they all parrot that little phrase, they think none too hard about that word pursuit. To follow, to chase, to inquire, to hunt, to seek. To track in order to overtake and capture. This they donâ\\x80\\x99t do. Instead, having been offered a promise of happiness, they progress to a feeling of entitlement for happiness, then make the leap that happiness should, therefore, be easily won, automatic. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s too much wrong in there to even scratch at that!\\nI am happy that I can aid those admirable men, both living and dead, who by their pens or their tongues have aided the great cause of human liberty and universal happiness.\\nThis planet is a \"Hell\" and there is no \"Heaven\" up there. So, learn to be \"Happy in Hell\".\\nYes: I exist inside my body.\\nSuccess, like happiness, is a by-product, not a goal.\\nA truly happy woman drives some men and almost every other woman absolutely crazy\\nMake a pledge to yourself right now, to declare that you are worth your time and energy.\\nI am the happiest man alive. I have that in me that can convert poverty to riches, adversity to prosperity, and I am more invulnerable than Archilles; Fortune hath not one place to hit me.\\nThe most important reason for your no is that you need your downtime so you wonâ\\x80\\x99t behave like a jerk because youâ\\x80\\x99re depleted. And you donâ\\x80\\x99t want to battle an appetite spiked by the stress of overcommitment. But thatâ\\x80\\x99s your secret; others donâ\\x80\\x99t need that information. So just smile, say no, thank you, and keep moving.\\nEasily mistaken, it is not about a love for adversity, it is about knowing a strength and a faith so great that adversity, in all its adverse manifestations, hardly even exists.\\nWhen our emotional health is in a bad state, so is our level of self-esteem. We have to slow down and deal with what is troubling us, so that we can enjoy the simple joy of being happy and at peace with ourselves.\\nWe think a wise person is someone who solves problems. Truth is, a wise person is someone who avoids problems.\\nThe cake had a trick candle that wouldn\\'t go out, so I didn\\'t get my wish. Which was just that it would always be like this, that my life could be a party just for me.\\nDads. Do your faces light up when you first see your child in the morning or when you come home from work? Do you not understand that a childâ\\x80\\x99s entire sense of value can revolve around what they see in your face when you first see them?\\nRiches can all be lost, but that happiness in your own heart can only be veiled, and it will bring you happiness again, as long as you live.\\nIf it is possible to die of grief then why on earth can\\'t someone be healed by happiness?\\nWithout enthusiasm then what we have surrounded ourselves with becomes worthless.\\nDo you not realize that your kids are going to make mistakes, and a lot of them? Do you not realize the damage you do when you push your sonâ\\x80\\x99s nose into his mishaps or make your daughter feel worthless because she bumped or spilled something? Do you have any idea how easy it is to make your child feel abject? Itâ\\x80\\x99s as simple as letting out the words, why would you do that!? or how many times have I told youâ\\x80¦\\nI think it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter if you or I or anybody else thinks homosexuality is a sin. It doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter if you or I think anything is a sin. It doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter if homosexuality is a sin or not. In fact, it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter if anything anybody else does is a sin or not.\\nThe most powerful relationship you will ever have is the relationship with yourself. It is in this relationship that you set the standard for all others.\\nYou don\\'t have to be like anyone else. You just need to learn more about your own creative self and start blooming.\\nIf you can have everything at fifty that you wanted when you were fifteen, you\\'re happy.\\nI swore that I would not suffer from the world\\'s grief and the world\\'s stupidity and cruelty and injustice and I made my heart as hard in endurance as the nether millstone and my mind as a polished surface of steel. I no longer suffered, but enjoyment had passed away from me.\\n[Happiness] comes when we choose to be who we are, to be ourselves, at this present moment in our lives.\\nIf you are doing things in order to be happy...\\nThere is no cosmetic for beauty like happiness.\\nWe had some good times at school.

Just go home, and be happy. Be happy, and let everyone around you be happy. Is that so hard?\\nSuccess is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get.\\nWhile amidst the crowd and seeking quieteness in another zone you can still get away from them by homing in on matters within.\\nYour beliefs have the power to unlock your inner genius or keep you from fully achieving your greatest potential.\\nOn the top of Cadair Idris,\\nI believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream - I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of medievalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal - to something finer, richer, than the Hellenic ideal, it may be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals.\\nLife isn\\'t about counting what you\\'ve earned or what you\\'ve done for others. I think life is in those in-between moments when you do something, and you feel really, truly happy just by doing it.\\nLife is such unutterable hell, solely because it is sometimes beautiful. If we could only be miserable all the time, if there could be no such things as love or beauty or faith or hope, if I could be absolutely certain that my love would never be returned: how much more simple life would be. One could plod through the Siberian salt mines of existence without being bothered about happiness.\\nThe man who makes everything that leads to happiness depends upon himself, and not upon other men, has adopted the very best plan for living happily. This is the man of moderation, the man of manly character and of wisdom.\\nThe basic mistake people make is to think that happiness is the goal!\\nOf the gladdest moments in human life, methinks, is the departure upon a distant journey into unknown lands. Shaking off with one mighty effort the fetters of Habit, the leaden weight of Routine, the cloak of many Cares and the slavery of Civilization, man feels once more happy.\\nPercy wakes me (fourteen)\\nMany people see happiness only in their future.\\nWhat I\\'m feeling, I think, is joy. And it\\'s been some time since I\\'ve felt that blinkered rush of happiness, This might be one of those rare events that lasts, one that\\'ll be remembered and recalled as months and years wind and ravel. One of those sweet, significant moments that leaves a footprint in your mind. A photograph couldn\\'t ever tell its story. It\\'s like something you have to live to understand. One of those freak collisions of fizzing meteors and looming celestial bodies and floating debris and one single beautiful red ball that bursts into your life and through your body like an enormous firework. Where things shift into focus for a moment, and everything makes sense. And it becomes one of those things inside you, a pearl among sludge, one of those big exaggerated memories you can invoke at any moment to peel away a little layer of how you felt, like a lick of ice cream. The flavor of grace.\\nOnce more I realized to what an extent earthly happiness is made to the measure of man. It is not a rare bird which we must pursue at one moment in heaven, at the next in our minds. Happiness is a domestic bird found in our own courtyards.\\nThere is one kind of laugh that I always did recommend; it looks out of the eye first with a merry twinkle, then it creeps down on its hands and knees and plays around the mouth like a pretty moth around the blaze of a candle, then it steals over into the dimples of the cheeks and rides around in those whirlpools for a while, then it lights up the whole face like the mellow bloom on a damask rose, then it swims up on the air, with a peal as clear and as happy as a dinner-bell, then it goes back again on gold tiptoes like an angel out for an airing, and it lies down on its little bed of violets in the heart where it came from.\\nâ\\x80¦she had nothing to do but to forgive herself and be happier than everâ\\x80¦\\nWhat did it matter if he existed for two or for twenty years? Happiness was the fact that he had existed.\\nJust like your body and lifestyle can be healthy or unhealthy, the same is true with your beliefs. Your beliefs can be your medicine or your poison.\\nThere is no greater misery than false joys.\\nI am happy.\\nNothing succeeds like indifference to success.\\nOur country in general assumes that \"the pursuit of happiness\" really means \"the pursuit of pleasure\" and that therefore pleasure is the greatest good.\\nThe truest of all truths is this: You are a child of God. Out of more than six billion people on earth now, He knows your name, what you fear and what you revere. He cares about the things you care about. He wants your happiness and success, and will reach to the farthest corner of the universe to see that you obtain your noblest dreams.\\nThrough my choices and actions, I have learned the most effective way of speaking to God is without saying a word.\\nEnjoy the rainbow while it lasts and don\\'t chase it when it\\'s gone.\\nThe world is so full of a number of things, I am sure we should all be as happy as kings. The world is full of happiness, and plenty to go round, if you are only willing to take the kind that comes your way.\\nJean was visited by one of her rare moments of happiness, one of those moments when the goodness of God was so real to her that it was like taste and scent; the rough strong taste of honey in the comb and the scent of water. Her thoughts of God had a homeliness that at times seemed shocking, in spite of their power, which could rescue her from terror or evil with an ease that astonished her.\\n[...]eu nunca tive porra de ideal nenhum, eu sÃ³ queria era salvar a minha, veja sÃ³ que coisa mais individualista elitista capitalista, eu sÃ³ queria era ser feliz, cara, gorda, burra, alienada e completamente feliz.\\nThe key to happiness? Find someone who would rather you be happy than themselves and then you treat them the same way. That way, no matter what, you are both trying to insure the OTHER person\\'s happiness and in turn, yours is undeniable.\\nHappiness: the feeling of being alive.\\nI hate you. I wish you was dead.\"\\nBut there was happiness elsewhere which no description can reach.\\nIf all our happiness is bound up entirely in our personal circumstances it is difficult not to demand of life more than it has to give.\\nI let all that anger and worry go because they don\\'t belong to me any more than the future does. And I don\\'t wanna feel them anyhow, because the truth is, whatever happens when this war ends, here and now, far from Richmond County, I\\'m freer than I\\'ve ever been.\\nWhen you are in a room with Kurtis, whether its one or a hundred he is the only person that matters.\\nAs we drove off into the moonless night, raindrops danced through our headlights like the fireflies of my childhood. I silently cursed the frailty of happiness and doubted whether it ever existed for me. I could remember happier times, though, and those memories fluttered about my mind like fireflies, beckoning with their elusive splendor. But chasing memories held no more promise than catching fireflies. The pursued feelings either vanished or lost their magic upon examination, hardly the green-glowing beauty seen at a distance. So I looked ahead of me and dreamed on into the darkness, hoping to one day find someone who would love me.\\nMany people are so poor that the only thing they have is money. Cultivate your spiritual growth.\\n... but happiness is to joy as an electric light bulb is to the sun. Happiness always has an object, you\\'re happy because of something, it\\'s a condition whose existence depends on external things. Joy, on the other hand, has no object. It seizes you for no apparent reason, it\\'s like the sun, its burning is fueled by its own heart.\\nListen, Harriet. I do unterstand. I know you don\\'t want either to give or to take ... You don\\'t want ever again to have to depend for happiness on another person.\"\\nAnd wasn\\'t it this bright boy you selected for beating and tortures after hours? Of course it was. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for their are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach man\\'s mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well-read man? Me? I won\\'t stomach them for a minute. And so when houses were finally fireproofed completely, all over the world (you were correct in your assumption the other night) there was no longer need of firemen for the old purposes. They were given the new job, as custodians of our peace of mind, the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of being inferior: official censors, judges and executors. That\\'s you, Montag, and that\\'s me.\\n#1487: Hug a cow.\\nMen who give up the common goal of all things that exist, thereby cease to exist themselves. Some may perhaps think it strange that we say that wicked men, who form the majority of men, do not exist; but that is how it is. I am not trying to deny the wickedness of the wicked; what I do deny is that their existence is absolute and complete existence. Just as you might call a corpse a dead man, but couldn\\'t simply call it a man, so I would agree that the wicked are wicked, but could not agree that they have unqualified existence.\\nOur ancestors derived less from life than we do, but they also expected much less and were less intent on controlling the future. We are of the arrogant generations who believe a lasting happiness was promised to us at birth. Promised? By whom?\\nO seasons, O castles,\\nI did not believe that a Cause which stood for a beautiful ideal, for anarchism, for release and freedom from convention and prejudice, should demand the denial of life and joy. I insisted that our Cause could not expect me to become a nun and that the movement would not be turned into a cloister. If it meant that, I did not want it.\\nLive near to God, and so all things will appear to you little In comparison to eternal realities.--\\nDas GlÃ¼ck ist das einzige, das sich verdoppelt, wenn man es teilt.\\nSettle, for sure and universally, what conduct will promote the happiness of a rational being.\\nThe important thing for you to remember, Montag, is we\\'re the Happiness Boys, the Dixie Duo, you and I and the others. We stand against the small tide of those who want to make everyone unhappy with conflicting theory and thought. We have our fingers in the dike. Hold steady. Don\\'t let the torrent of melancholy and drear philosophy drown our world. We depend on you. I don\\'t think you realize how important you are, we are, to our happy world as it stands now.\\nPeace and happiness are powerful weapons against the Egos.\\nAt some point in the night she had a dream. Or it was possible that she was partially awake, and was only remembering a dream? She was alone among the rocks on a dark coast beside the sea. The water surged upward and fell back languidly, and in the distance she heard surf breaking slowly on a sandy shore. It was comforting to be this close to the surface of the ocean and gaze at the intimate nocturnal details of its swelling and ebbing. And as she listened to the faraway breakers rolling up onto the beach, she became aware of another sound entwined with the intermittent crash of waves: a vast horizontal whisper across the bossom of the sea, carrying an ever-repeated phrase, regular as a lighthouse flashing: Dawn will be breaking soon. She listened a long time: again and again the scarcely audible words were whispered across the moving water. A great weight was being lifted slowly from her; little by little her happiness became more complete, and she awoke. Then she lay for a few minutes marveling the dream, and once again fell asleep.\\nHappiness and joy are not the same. For what does the fervent craving for joy mean? It does not mean that we wish at any cost to experience the psychic state of being joyful. We want to have reason for joy, for an unceasing joy that fills us utterly, sweeps all before it, exceeds all measure.\\nEarthly contemplation means to the Christian, we have said, this above all: that behind all that we directly encounter the Face of the incarnate Logos becomes visible... Contemplation does not ignore the \"historical Gethsemane,\" does not ignore the mystery of evil, guilt and its bloody atonement. The happiness of contemplation is a true happiness, indeed the supreme happiness; but it is founded upon sorrow.\\nYou know, a few months ago, I made a terrible mistake. I realized something, and instead of crushing the thought the moment it came I... I let it hang on, and now I know it to be true. And I\\'m afraid it\\'s stuck in my head forever. These are the best days of our lives. It\\'s a terrible thing to know, but I know it.\\nJulia was as happy as Betsy was, almost. One nice thing about Julia was that she rejoiced in other people\\'s luck.\\nit was dawning on me how uphill a poet\\'s path was, and I confessed to her that if I had to be the choice between being happy or being a poet, I\\'d choose to be happy.\\nNijedna tuÄ\\x91a sreÄ\\x87a nije bez pomalo sreÄ\\x87e i za nas druge. Zato je jedna velika mudrost od tuÄ\\x91e sreÄ\\x87e praviti sreÄ\\x87u i za sebe.\\nOnce we got to eating, the idea of happiness returned to me. Not the feeling, the idea. Would a regular girl be happy simply eating a hot meal with a great deal of chew to it? Maybe happiness is a simple thing. Maybe it\\'s as simple as the salty taste of pork, and the vast deal of chewing in it, and how, when the chew is gone, you can still scrape at the bone with your bottom teeth and suck at the marrow.\\nNo other thing or no other person is going to make me happy in life, I just have to do that myself.\\nNot matter what your sacred or religious book is, it\\'s not how well you know the book, it\\'s how well you\\'re in alignment with the author.\\n...with a rush of feeling he felt that this must be happiness. As soon as the thought came to him, he fought it back, blaming the whiskey. The very idea was as dangerous as presumptive speech: happiness could not be sought or worried into being, or even fully grasped; it should be allowed its own slow pace so that it passes unnoticed, if it ever comes at all.\\nHappiness is so nonsynonymous with joy or pleasure that it is not infrequently sought and felt in grief and deprivation.\\nHappiness is essentially a gift; we are not the forgers of our own felicity.\\nLearn to cherish the chase as much as you treasure the trophy.\\nEmmy has embarked on her journey to enrich the world with smiles. They are free, healthy, and often, very contagious.\\n...[A] certain degree of un-understanding (not mis-, but un-) is the only possible sanctuary which one human being can offer to another in the midst of the devastating intimacy of a happy marriage.\\nI should have seen his weaknesses and only given him a section of myself but I loved him to my core, no matter who he was. There were no hidden places in my heart that would not welcome him or any sacred ground inside my being that he could not walk upon.\\nHeureux sont ceux qui peuvent aimer et haÃ¯r sans feinte, sans dÃ©tour, sans nuance.\\nWherein lies happiness? In that which becks\\nThere is no such thing as escape after all, only an exchange of one set of difficulties for another. It wasn\\'t Mark or the farm or marriage I was trying to shake loose from but my own imperfect self, and even if I kept moving, she would dog me all the way around the world, forever.\\nIf you investigate the matter deeply enough and widely enough, you will find that happiness eludes nearly all men despite the fact that they are forever seeking it. The fortunate and successful few are those who have stopped seeking with the ego alone and allow the search to be directed inwardly by the higher self. They alone can find a happiness unblemished by defects or deficiencies, a Supreme Good which is not a further source of pain and sorrow but an endless source of satisfaction and peace.\\nHappiness is like time and space--we make and measure it ourselves; it is a fancy--as big, as little, as you please; just a thing of contrasts and comparisons, like health or strength or beauty or any other good--that wouldn\\'t even be noticed but for sad personal experience of its opposite!--or its greater!\\nIt must be nice to be so strong and to think it\\'s because you\\'re so good, that you live right and eat right, so you deserve your health and happiness. But there is such a thing as luck, and there\\'s more bad luck than good in this world.\\nIt required all his delicate Epicurean education to prevent his doing something about it; he had to repeat over to himself his favorite notions: that the injustice and unhappiness in the world is a constant; that the theory of progress is a delusion; that the poor, never having known happiness, are insensible to misfortune. Like all the rich he could not bring himself to believe that the poor (look at their houses, look at their clothes) could really suffer. Like all the cultivated he believed that only the widely read could be said to know that they were unhappy.\\nMy dear Scipio and Laelius. Men, of course, who have no resources in themselves for securing a good and happy life find every age burdensome. But those who look for all happiness from within can never think anything bad which Nature makes inevitable.\\nFate would never permit happiness to a man of such talent-\\nThe kind of happy I was that day at the Vet when \"Hawk\" Dawson actually doffed his red \"C\" cap to me, and everyone cheered and practically convulsed into tears - you can\\'t patent that. It was one shining moment of glory that was instantly gone. Whereas life, real life, is different and can\\'t even be appraised as simply \"happy\", but only in terms of \"Yes, I\\'ll take it all, thanks\" or \"No, I believe I won\\'t.\" Happy, as my poor father used to say, is a lot of hooey. Happy is a circus clown, a sitcom, a greeting card. Life, though, life\\'s about something sterner. But also something better. A lot better. Believe me.\\nHuman unhappiness is evidence of our immortality.\\nTo the wise, peace of mind is the result of being fine with how things are; to the foolish, the result of things being fine.\\nOne honest John Tompkins, a hedger & ditcher,\\nA felicidade nunca Ã© graciosa.\\nWhen you\\'ve succeeded, you\\'d say:\\nHappiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.\\nDas GlÃ¼ck ist nicht in den Dingen, die wir besitzen, sondern in den Dingen, die zu besitzen wir glauben.\\nThe amusements of life, he argued, should be accepted with the same philosophy as its ills.

To pursue the past means to lose yourself in thoughts about what you looked like in the past, what your feelings were then, what rank and position you held, what happiness or suffering you experienced then. Giving rise to such thoughts entangles you in the past. Bhikkhus, what is meant by â\\x80\\x98losing yourself in the futureâ\\x80\\x99? To lose yourself in the future means to lose yourself in thoughts about the future. You imagine, hope, fear, or worry about the future, wondering what you will look like, what your feelings will be, whether you will have happiness or suffering. Giving rise to such thoughts entangles you in the future.\\nBut all hugs must end, so they pulled apart, just a little. That hurt too much, so he rested his forehead and nose upon hers. Sometimes happiness is just about more than a body can bear.\\nGoing further back, have the seventy or so turbulent millennia since the Cognitive Revolution made the world a better place to live? Was the late Neil Armstrong, whose footprint remains intact on the windless moon, happier than the nameless hunter-gatherer who 30,000 years ago left her handprint on a wall in Chauvet Cave? If not, what was the point of developing agriculture, cities, writing, coinage, empires, science and industry?\\nOur appointment with life is in the present moment.

It is only your attachments. What is it that you miss when it is lost? It is the object of your attachment. Ponder over this. Find out what it is that grips your very life, without which you feel miserable and destitute; that is the center of your attachment.\\nFeeling guilt dims our light. Instead of dimming our light to make others feel more comfortable, we could just continue to shine and foster the rise of the vibrations of those around us.\\nI guess everybody thinks about old times, even the happiest people.\\nWe are souls, eternal and perfect, captains of our mystic ships: gods and goddesses of our universe. We are beautiful, we pearls of grit. We, the ember of everything. Our uniqueness IS what makes us special, and the expression of it is our gift to the rest of us.

During the American Civil War he signed an order transferring certain regiments, but Secretary of War Edwin Stanton refused to execute it, calling the president a fool. When Lincoln heard he replied, â\\x80\\x98If Stanton said Iâ\\x80\\x99m a fool then I must be, for heâ\\x80\\x99s nearly always right, and he says what he thinks. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll step over and see for myself.â\\x80\\x99 He did, and when Stanton convinced him the order was in error, Lincoln quietly withdrew it. Part of Lincolnâ\\x80\\x99s greatness lay in his ability to rise above pettiness, ego, and sensitivity to other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s opinions. He wasnâ\\x80\\x99t easily offended. He welcomed criticism, and in doing so demonstrated one of the strengths of a truly great person: humility. So, have you been criticised?

We need to be bored and not have anything to use to shield the boredom away from us. We need to be lonely and see what it is we really feel when we are. If we continue to distract ourselves so we never have to face the realities in front of us, when the time comes and you are faced with something bigger than what your phone, food, or friends can fix, you will be in big trouble.\\nIf you behave in a manner that poisons your relationship, donâ\\x80\\x99t be surprised when it dies.\\nOne thing I have come to realize is that love is not always happiness.\\nIn stating these matters, I speak an open and disinterested language, dictated by no passion but that of humanity. To me, who have not only refused offers, because I thought them improper, but have declined rewards I might with reputation have accepted, it is no wonder that meanness and imposition appear disgustful. Independence is my happiness, and I view things as they are, without regard to place or person; my country is the world, and my religion is to do good.\\nIf I die very young, hear this:\\nAre you what is called a lucky man? Well, you are sad every day. Each day has its great grief or its little care.

De niÃ±o, mi himno favorito era: Â«Cansado del mundo y con el peso de mis pecadosÂ». A los cinco aÃ±os yo pensaba que si habÃ¬a de vivir setenta no habÃ¬a pasado aÃºn mÃ¡s que la catorceava parte de mi vida vital, y me parecÃ¬a casi insoportable la enorme cantidad de aburrimiento que me aguardaba. En la adolescencia la vida me era odiosa, y estaba continuamente al borde del suicidio, del cual me librÃ© gracias al deseo de saber mÃ¡s matemÃ¡ticas. Hoy, por el contrario, gusto de la vida, y casi estoy por decir que cada aÃ±o que pasa la encuentro mÃ¡s gustosa. Esto es debido, en parte, a haber descubierto cuÃ¡les eran las cosas que deseaba mÃ¡s y haber adquirido gradualmente muchas de ellas. En parte es debido tambiÃ©n a haberme desprendido, felizmente, de ciertos deseos (la adquisiciÃ³n del conocimiento indudable acerca de algo) como esencialmente inasequibles.

Not very far away are Death Valley, and Yosemite, and Sequoia Forest with its giant trees which were growing long before the Parthenon was built; they are the oldest living things in the world. One should visit such places often, and be conscious, in the midst of the city, of their surrounding presence. For this is the real nature of California and the secret of its fascination; this untamed, undomesticated, aloof, prehistoric landscape which relentlessly reminds the traveller of his human condition and the circumstances of his tenure upon the earth. \"You are perfectly welcome,\" it tells him, \"during your short visit. Everything is at your disposal. Only, I must warn you, if things go wrong, don\\'t blame me. I accept no responsibility. I am not part of your neurosis. Don\\'t cry to me for safety.

Nor, God knows, one of the rights of women.\\nHe found himself remembering how on one summer morning they two had started from New York in search of happiness. They had never expected to find it, perhaps, yet in itself that quest had been happier than anything he expected forevermore. Life, it seemed, must be a setting up of props around one - otherwise it was disaster. There was no rest, no quiet.

Such certainties all mean, at bottom, one and the same thing: that the world is plumb and sound; that everything comes to its appointed goal; that in spite of all appearances, underlying all things is - peace, salvation, gloria; that nothing and no one is lost; that \"God holds in his hand the beginning, middle, and end of all that is.\" Such nonrational, intuitive certainties of the divine base of all that is can be vouchsafed to our gaze even when it is turned toward the most insignificant-looking things, if only it is a gaze inspired by love. That, in the precise sense, is contemplation...\\nWhen you feel down and out you must reach up and out--to Spirit! Our strength will only resonate deep within your souls if you open your heart and minds with us.\\nRepose, leisure, peace, belong among the elements of happiness. If we have not escaped from harried rush, from mad pursuit, from unrest, from the necessity of care, we are not happy. And what of contemplation? Its very premise is freedom from the fetters of workaday busyness. Moreover, it itself actualizes this freedom by virtue of being intuition.\\nTout bonheur est un chef-d\\'oeuvre: la moindre erreur le fausse, la moindre hÃ©sitation l\\'altÃ¨re, la moindre lourder le dÃ©pare, la moindre sottise l\\'abÃªtit.\\nAnd this is not the happiness of a magazine writer who sends in his gay little philosophy of life to the editor for the one paragraph spread in front of the magazine: This is a serious happiness full of doubts and strengths.

At twenty years old, had I articulated what I thought I needed in life, I would have probably said a big house, a successful husband, and a great career.

I think it is deemed good that you two should live in peace and be happy - not as angels but as few are happy amongst mortals. Some lives are thus blessed: it is God\\'s will: it is the attesting trace and lingering evidence of Eden. Other lives run from the first another course. Other travellers encounter weather fitful and gusty wild and variable - breast adverse winds are belated and overtaken by the early closing winter night. Neither can this happen without the sanction of God and I know that amidst His boundless works is somewhere stored the secret of this last fate\\'s justice: I know that His treasures contain the proof as the promise of its mercy.\\nSome of the most memorable, and least regrettable, nights of my own youth were spent in coon hunting with farmers. There is no denying that these activities contributed to the economy of farm households, but a further fact is that they were pleasures; they were wilderness pleasures, not greatly different from the pleasures pursued by conservationists and wilderness lovers. As I was always aware, my friends the coon hunters were not motivated just by the wish to tree coons and listen to hounds and listen to each other, all of which were sufficiently attractive; they were coon hunters also because they wanted to be afoot in the woods at night. Most of the farmers I have known, and certainly the most interesting ones, have had the capacity to ramble about outdoors for the mere happiness of it, alert to the doings of the creatures, amused by the sight of a fox catching grasshoppers, or by the puzzle of wild tracks in the snow.\\nHere we must take account of one of St. Thomas\\'s conceptual distinctions, which at first seems like unnecessary caviling. It is the distinction between \"uncreated\" and \"created\" happiness. We have here something which, while not at all obvious, is nevertheless fraught with consequences for our whole feeling about life. Namely, this: what does indeed make us happy is the infinite and uncreated richness of God; but participation in this, happiness itself, is entirely a \"creatural\" reality governed from within by our humanity; it is not something that descends overwhelmingly upon us from outside. That is, it is not only something that happens to us; we ourselves are intensely active participants in our own happiness.\\nIf you can\\'t see a benefit of the challenges in the present, know that you\\'re giving a present to your future.\" â\\x80\\x94Bright Side Up: 100 Ways to Be Happier Right Now\\nThe common element in all the special forms of contemplation is the loving, yearning, affirming bent toward that happiness which is the same as God Himself, and which is the aim and purpose of all that happens in the world.\\nThe door to heaven is open to us at any time we are willing to accept that we are of absolutely no importance. The bars of our own hell - the mind-forged manacles as Blake put it - are our attempts to justify ourselves or prove our self-worth. Accept that none of this matters and we can see that heaven is all around us. It is there in a childâ\\x80\\x99s smile, in the rain that waters the earth, even in the maggots that rise in new life from dead meat. All around us is evidence that life and love are eternal and unbroken by strife and suffering.\\nYet some happiness must and would arise, from the very conviction, that he did suffer.\\n... each gratification points to the ultimate one, and that all happiness has some connection with eternal beatitude. Some connection, if only this: that every fulfillment this side of Heaven instantly reveals its inadequacy. It is immediately evident that such satisfactions are not enough; they are not what we have really sought; they cannot really satisfy us at all.\\nTherefore, for me, living true to my self may be defined as: Making the daily choices in all areas of my life that are in the best interests of my survival, evolution and prosperity, that aid the ongoing achievement of the highest physical, mental and spiritual objectives of which I am capable, that are based on the most correct assessment of reality I have available, and that honor the evolving truth of who I am and who I choose to be, all in the personal pursuit of freedom, function, fun, as well as the highest good of all.\\ndisputing nothing is the first step through the difficult door of happiness\\nâ\\x80¦for I look upon the Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people.\\nWe, Equality 7-2521, were not happy in those year in the Home of the Students. It was not that the learning was too hard for us. It was that the learning was too easy. This is a great sin, to be born with a head which is too quick. It is not good to be different from our brothers, but it is evil to be superior to them. The Teachers told us so, and they frowned when they looked at us.\\nHow can one explain this trend towards a more colorless and shallow life? Well, the work was easier, if less healthy, and it brought in more money, more leisure, and perhaps more entertainment. A day in the country is long and hard. And yet the fruits of their present life were worthless compared to a single coin of their former life: a rest in the evening and a rural festivity. That they no longer knew the old kind of happiness was obvious from the discontentment which spread over their features. Soon dissatisfaction, prevailing over all their other moods, became their religion.\\nMy art is that of the 35mm kind; my poetry is of the lead and ink kind; my happiness is of the product of both; and my legacy is of the story of my soul, that my life left behind\\nHe stared to sea. \"I gave up all ideas of practicing medicine. In spite of what I have just said about the wave and the water, in those years in France I am afraid I lived a selfish life. That is, I offered myself every pleasure. I traveled a great deal.

I suppose I was fortunate. It took me only five years to discover what some rich people never discover â\\x80\\x94 that we all have a certain capacity for happiness and unhappiness.

There would be no reason for objecting to this, since the gods, too were not exactly fair. But at least people saw temples instead of termite architecture.

Which is why, being non-frustrated is key to constructive action, on any front, in any walk of Life.\\nI had carried the burden of believing that because I was able to write, sing, and produce my songs, become famous, and gain access to unimaginable wealth, I didn\\'t deserve personal happiness too.\\nThis isn\\'t about strength,\" I told him. \"It\\'s about who you\\'re choosing to make happy.\\nEvery thought that awakens, is conceived in the reflection...\\nI felt like somebody had just poured a pitcher of joy over me and now it was settling, liquid and bright, into all my hollow places.\\nUltimately, only what is to happen, happens.

This doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean we have to be miserable in the meantime. We canâ\\x80\\x99t help each other if we donâ\\x80\\x99t help ourselves. But we have to go further than the smiley face rhetoric of commoditized mindfulness. Dissatisfaction and unhappiness are not impediments to revolution; they are its fuel.\\nDo you compare your life to someone elseâ\\x80\\x99s highlight reel on social media? What if you were to drop your thoughts of comparison to others and just take steps towards whatever you want in life?\\nIn the moment, an anticipated rush of sugar, or of dopamine, or sinking into a couch to be entertained by a screen, can seem like the best thing in the world. But it is not those moments that we remember, and it is not those moments that we treasure. They are not rich with meaning. Fleeting, easy satisfaction does not a meaningful life make.\\nI think that everyone, no matter how many troubles he may have when he grows up, ought to have a happy childhood to look back upon. And if I ever have any children of my own, no matter how unhappy I may be, I am not going to let them have any cares until they grow up.\\nRemember: this is the only Life you have. And this one Life is yours. So, be yourself. Live being who you are, doing what you believe in â\\x80\\x93 as long as it does not harm the very idea of being human (so being destructive or violent is a no-no!). This is the only way to be happy â\\x80\\x93 and to be at peace with yourself and with your world!\\nIn a country addicted to the virus of consumption, wealth, individualism, and judgement â\\x80\\x94 be a person who is committed to the act of serving with love. To the act of spreading love. To serving with love. To uplifting with love. United we stand, divided we fall. Choose your part. Choose leadership. Be a leader, not a follower. You were born an original. Donâ\\x80\\x99t die a copy. Freedom ainâ\\x80\\x99t free and that just so happens to be the problem and the answer to the solution. All men are created equal but not treated equal. The only thing that is free is love, and love with conditions is not love. Liberty and life with conditions is not liberty and life. Ask more of your country and your countrymen. Protect all Americanâ\\x80\\x99s rights to true freedom. Not the declaration of freedom but the actualization of freedom, which includes true liberty, true equality and the unconditional ability to pursue the highest virtues of life.\\nWho is rich?

Make an effort to enhance Relationships, because that\\'s the key to your happiness.\\nIt\\'s strange how as one grows older one forgets the things that make one happy.\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s easy to make assumptions about people, especially on social media. We see a few photographs and some updates and we compare the few highlights we get with the worst impressions we have of our own lives.\\nComparison to others is like a mind virus that keeps us small our whole lives. It keeps us in a victim mindset, and through it we give away our power to things outside our control.\\nOur thinking is not a fixed entity, and therefore it makes no sense to try to change it.\\nWhen we let go of any misunderstandings we may have, this gives rise to new thinking and new ideas; it unleashes creativity and helps us have a better experience of life.\\nI started to see that rather than overthinking every decision, I could simply decide to make a decisionâ\\x80\\x94any decision. I would learn something whatever happened. Each time I did this it seemed that my ability to tap into my gut increased and my tendency to spend too long analyzing diminished.\\nAn insight is just a thought Iâ\\x80\\x99ve not had before.\\nMy intellect is a wonderful thing and it is helpful, but I now see that there is another, deeper place of intelligence within meâ\\x80\\x94and everyone else. Once we tap into it we can begin to transform our lives.\\nIf my mind is busy thinking about things like how someone hurt or upset me and how I can protect myself or get back at them, Iâ\\x80\\x99m too busy in my head to enjoy the present moment.\\nTake a few moments to see if you can notice this silence beneath all of your thinking, ideas, beliefs and stories.\\nPlaying with hearts & hiding yourself is much much easy; but to make people happy to see YOU happy is difficult. You may not have importance of yourself, but it is very important to know that most of the time we humans are made for each other. We are the part of each otherâ\\x80\\x99s life. People love you not because they already got tuned up with you. No one can explain the attachments but we can know the relations. No one in this world is so emotion less that they can\\'t understand what you feel. You just need to open-up once. See the miracle of love around you. Say them that it\\'s you, experience the beauty of people. People need each other not for the worldliness; life of the people depends on each other but for the humanity. Love is far noble than ethics, because ethics are support to live the life but love is essential to deal with the life. Please, never say a single word about death in your life. You have to understand your importance when you see tears in their eyes.\\nIf you pay close attention to your Lifeâ\\x80\\x99s journey so far, you will realize that you have always â\\x80\\x93 and only â\\x80\\x93 got what you need. What you want has come to you, on its own, in its own time, and often only when you have stopped wanting it! This is the way of Life. Understand this. And you will live happily ever after!\\nNever join two things that would be happier apart.\\nÙ\\x8aØ§Ù\\x84Ù\\x8aØª Ø§Ù\\x84Ø²Ù\\x85Ø§Ù\\x86 Ù\\x8aØ¹Ù\\x88Ø¯Ø\\x8c Ù\\x88Ø³Ù\\x88Ø§Ù\\x84Ù\\x81 Ø§Ù\\x84Ø±Ø¨Ø¬ Ù\\x81Ù\\x8a ØºØ±Ø§Ø´ Ø§Ù\\x84Ù\\x83Ù\\x88Ù\\x84Ø§ Ù\\x88ØºÙ\\x8aØ±Ù\\x87Ø§.

For what He\\'ll grant will be what He loves. So, if God hates it, hate it also.

Our happiness-seeking circuitry, long evolved in situations where sugar, comfort, abundance, and safe thrills were rare, is now on overdrive, helping us find that which markets have made ubiquitous. So we need to reschool our happiness-seeking circuitry, train it to find and appreciate legitimately rare or valuable things. Sugar, comfort, abundance, and safe thrills are no longer legitimately rare or valuable.

No, he will not because he found what he was not looking for, not what he was looking for!\\nPleasure and desire are altogether different things in the brain.\\nThe principle is clear, our hearts long for that one thing that will satisfy us. But we\\'ve deprived ourselves so much by not meeting Christ first.\\nThrough curiosity, I forget my failures and sorrows, and I feel great happiness.\\nLeonardo da Vinci: And now my friends I know the secret.\\nLetting go does not mean giving up on Life. It means giving in to Life. It means going with the flow. It is a prayerful state, of complete surrender, of trusting the process of Life.\\nMaybe it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t the lack of achievements that had made her and her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s parents unhappy, maybe it was the expectation to achieve in the first place.\\nHappiness is easy to achieve if you\\'re not afraid of it.\\nSpirituality teaches you to be fearless. When you realize that everything that you are trying to cling on to or protect, including your own Life, will eventually be gone, will be taken away, you turn fearless!\\nSaints and sinners are chasing the very same thing: happiness. What differs are the vehicles with which they do the chasing.\\nI\\'ve heard it said that the happiest time in our lives is the period when pop songs really mean\\nWhen all other thoughts leave us, we are left with love - even in the direst of circumstances. There is power in love. We do not need to be victims of circumstance. We do not need to be afraid. We do not need to fear those who commit crimes or who dislike us. We simply need to allow love to emerge. When we do this, we tap into our own source of unlimited power.\\nLife enticed you to love it. It lured you on with the sweet, terrible music of happiness. Life told you: Love, Get Married, Work, Hope, Pray, Put Everything on My Altar. And in the end it abandoned you without a backward glance...\\nAcceptance is a great state to be in. It surely does not make a problem disappear. But the struggle stops. The â\\x80\\x98Why?â\\x80\\x99, â\\x80\\x98Why Me?â\\x80\\x99, questions die down. There is complete calm. When there is calm, there is focus, there is a sharpness. When you are focused, you invest yourself in solving the problem. You stop complaining about the problem. When you are non-complaining, you are at peace; you are happy with what is.\\nHappiness was different in childhood. It was so much then a matter simply of accumulation, of taking things - new experiences, new emotions - and applying them like so many polished tiles to what would someday be the marvellously finished pavilion of the self. And incredulity, that too was a large part of being happy, I mean that euphoric inability fully to believe one\\'s simple luck.\\nBefore you start trying to change your partner so that you feel happy, start by working on feeling happy on your own, because what if feeling happy on your own is the actual secret to the happiness you desire to receive from your partner in that relationship?\\nThe best gift that a child can receive from their parents is a happy home and a thriving companionship between them. Of course, in some instances, the parents may choose to go their separate ways. Even so, harmonious co-parenting is still possible when both parents prioritize their childâ\\x80\\x99s wellbeing over their own interests!\\nWilderness is source of Happiness..\\nHappy Trails to You---until We Meet Again......Happy Trails to YOU---KEEP SMILING UNTIL THEN.\\nSome outcomes, changes and circumstances may seem to be negative in the moment.\\nLike spirituality, insanity frees us from the addiction to happiness.\\nSuccess is the longest route to deciding to be happy.\\nSixty seconds of laughter is way more pleasurable than sixty days of happiness alone.\\nA chef can make a dish with anything available. A child can make a play with anything available. You can make joy with anything available to you.\\nLife intrinsically has no meaning. You came with nothing. You will go with nothing. But you have the opportunity to make your Life meaningful. You can do this in small doses by doing multiple things that you love doing. Or you can do this expansively by being engaged with a larger-than-you cause, your Purpose. Here \\'meaningful\\' really means making each moment count, by living it fully, by celebrating it! Simply, as long as you do what makes you come alive, even if you don\\'t define it or connect it with a sense of Purpose, you are living meaningfully!\\nOnce more\\nThis had been his biggest flaw: he\\'d clung so tightly to the displays he presumed would make him relevant and needed, and powerful, he forgot about where power truly lay. With us, his family, his wife and daughters, and the happiness and peace we\\'d found with each other and ourselves.\\nA conversation that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t affect the soul is an unfinished journey!\\nTo expect nothing not even that the sun will rise tomorrow-that is freedom. That is happiness.\\nYou are at peace with your world when you donâ\\x80\\x99t judge others. Learning to be non-judgmental is an art. And you learn this art through discipline. You learn by choosing not to comment, not to offer opinion on the actions, comments and lives of others. Being silent is key to being disciplined â\\x80\\x93 and to being happy!\\nToo many choices make people unhappy\\nThe extent, to which you are happy, is in direct proportion to your recognition of what you have to be thankful.\\nNever confuse reputation for character.\\n... perhaps it is the loving that counts, not the being loved in return - that perhaps true loving can never know any thing but happiness.\\nThe sunshine in her smile seeped into him, warming him as it had for days. She wore a simple cotton dress borrowed from a girl in the village for the trip to the accident site. It was white with bits of lace at the cuffs and neckline, making her seem young, innocent, and full of life. And he had nearly robbed her of that life.\\nWhere there is harmony, there is happiness.\\nSensuality is never about sex. Itâ\\x80\\x99s about the quality of your life.\\nSensuality isnâ\\x80\\x99t just about sex. Itâ\\x80\\x99s about the overall quality of your life. Sex is just a small part of it.\\nWhen you get to my age, doing things that make one happy is far more important than doing things that make sense.\\nIf you\\'re happy doing what you\\'re doing, then nobody can tell you you\\'re not successful.\\nI thought being rich would make everything better,he said. Wylan glanced back at his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s mansion. I could have told you it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t work that way.\\nInterbeing is the understanding that nothing exists separately from anything else. We are all interconnected. By taking care of another person, you take care of yourself. By taking care of yourself, you take care of the other person. Happiness and safety are not individual matters. If you suffer, I suffer. If you are not safe, I am not safe. There is no way for me to be truly happy if you are suffering. If you can smile, I can smile too. The understanding of interbeing is very important. It helps us to remove the illusion of loneliness, and transform the anger that comes from the feeling of separation.\\nThe fools! They always choose greed and ambition over happiness.\\nOne of the Keys to Happiness, is to surround yourself with the right people.\\nI have chosen happiness. Out of all the emotions set out on the table, I have selected it. It is by far the superior opinion. It\\'s insane to think I would have ever picked one of those shittier emotions before--when all the while, I could have chosen shiny, shimmering, iridescent happiness.\\nWe are unhappy because we are incapable of concentrating on the present, we feel the wounds of the past and we are fearful of the uncertainties of the future.\\nI had known contentment before, brief snatches of time in which I pursued solitary pleasure: skipping stones or dicing or dreaming. But in truth, it had been less a presence than an absence, a laying aside of dread: my father was not near, nor boys. I was not hungry, or tired, or sick. This feeling was different.\\nThose who seek happiness in marriage always come back with disappointments.\\nI was so dazed when I got to the station that I almost took a train for St. Louis. And you were pretty dazed, too. You forgot to give me any tea. But weâ\\x80\\x99re both very, very happy, arenâ\\x80\\x99t we?\\nSmall accomplishments can make you feel like a winner too.\\nHappiness is a stack of books.\\nBut Domenica thought: I really would like things to be forever. I would like to be able to sit at this table once a week, perhaps, with these friends. I would like to talk about the things we talk about, the small things, whatever happened in the world. I would like to wake up in the morning and not think that things were getting worse. I would like not to have to listen to the exchange of insults between politicians. I would like to hear of people co-operating with one another and helping others and bringing succour and comfort to the needy and... and I would like not to think that we were still in the seventeenth century, as divided amongst ourselves as they were at that time, pitted against each other, with one vision of the good battling another, and people despising others for their opinions.\\nWhat if you worked without destructive stress? How much better would your life be?\\nWant to be more productive? Uncover the subtle nuances that steal your productivity and fix those.\\nTypically, when we face a challenge, we immediately look for a solution. It feels logical, but solution-first thinking is not the best way to solve problems. First, you need to go to the heart of the issue. Then solutions have a fighting chance to stick.\\nIf your presence is a reason for others to be happy, then you will feel true joy.\\nIt is true happiness when you can become a reason for someone else\\'s happiness\\nSurvival is woven into the fabric of who I am. I never asked, \\'Why did this happen to me?\\' bur rather, \\'How can I overcome this situation?\\' It is easy to let past trauma or injustice rule your life forever, but I want to be free, so I needed to understand and forgive others ... above all, I keep in mind that my happiness is up to me now ... I am very proud of my ancestors, my home country, and my past. I have just learned to leave out the parts that don\\'t serve me as a woman, a mother, a human.\\nThese girls were anxious to be good, and made many excellent resolutions, but they did not keep them very well, and were constantly saying, \\'If we only had this,\\' or \\'if we could only do that,\\' quite forgetting how much they already had, and how many pleasant things they actually could do; so they asked an old woman what spell they could use to make them happy, and she said, \"When you feel discontented, think over your blessings, and be grateful.\\nI searched my stomach for that tight feeling, the sensation of waiting for the other shoe to drop. I could find it, if I tried hard enough, but for once, I didn\\'t want to. The moment felt worth whatever pain it might bring later, and I tried to repeat that to myself until I was sure I would be able to remember it if I needed to.\\nI can miss my dad and hate him at the same time. I can be worried about this book and torn up about my family and sick over the house I\\'m living in, and still look at lake Michigan and feel overwhelmed by how big it is. I spent all last summer thinking I\\'d never be happy again, and now, a year later, I still feel sick and worried and angry, but at moments, I\\'m so happy. Bad things don\\'t dig down through your life until the pit\\'s so deep that nothing good will ever be big enough to make you happy again. No matter how much shit, there will always be wildflowers. There will always be Pete\\'s and Maggies and rainstorms in forests and sun on waves.\\nIf we see that we donâ\\x80\\x99t get to control our thinking, that we donâ\\x80\\x99t choose what thoughts pop up in a split second, then we will feel a full range of emotions and there is nothing to do about it. Often trying to do something about a feeling we have reinforces it rather than allowing it to pass naturally.\\nWhat if you didnâ\\x80\\x99t need to process or accept any negative feelings you were having?\\nI hadnâ\\x80\\x99t ever considered that guilt was simply a feeling, and that any meaning attached to it was made up.\\nGuilt simply cannot tell me whether I am a good person or a bad person. There is no chart on which I can check the amount of guilt Iâ\\x80\\x99m feeling and see how it corresponds to my goodness or otherwise. Guilt is a reflection of my thinking about a certain action or behavior I have taken, or not taken, in the past. Guilt does not and cannot change the past. It often doesnâ\\x80\\x99t even stop a person from taking the same action again in similar circumstances.\\nForgiveness doesnâ\\x80\\x99t make sense when you understand that someoneâ\\x80\\x99s actions canâ\\x80\\x99t make you feel anything. Similarly, someone feeling bad canâ\\x80\\x99t make me feel good or satisfied or content.\\nYour guilty thinking is only held in place by your thinking. Not engaging with it, not analyzing it, not thinking about it will allow it to pass right on byâ\\x80\\x94as it was always meant to do. What a gift to give yourself.\\nThe more I was afraid of getting hurt, the more cautious I was, and this impacted my ability to deepen my relationships with others.\\nThe more I saw fear for what it wasâ\\x80\\x94a reflection of my thinkingâ\\x80\\x94the easier it was for my thinking to return to loving thoughts.\\nI would tell you stories from dawn to dusk if it meant filling your eyes with happiness.\\nFind something new to live for, said Peter softly. I had to do that when I lost my family. Granted, they werenâ\\x80\\x99t dead, but they were as good as dead for twelve years.\\nSo this nostalgia is, what, an echo of a happiness? Or a long-delayed one? Is it an outline of one, from trying to remember a happiness I knew I should have felt in the moment but that most likely wasn\\'t really there? Or, maybe nostalgia is to feel happiness about something that is over because it is over. That in order to feel happy about it, it must be something that you can\\'t go back to and affect, that you can\\'t mess up from where you are now, but also, that you can\\'t really feel at all.\\nThe search of success doesn\\'t happen in happiness ; a bit of sorrow, a bit of failure, and the feeling of rise again is responsible to give you one\\nLa felicidad es agradable, sÃ¬, pero tambiÃ©n es... fugaz. Y se basa en lo que se tiene o no en un momento dado. La felicidad... tiene que ser alimentada continuamente. No llena de propÃ³sito la vida. No da sentido a la existencia.\\nYour eyes aren\\'t rivers there to weep, but a place for crows to rest their feet.\\nWe should live our life in such a way where we inspire younger generation to carry forward true essence of happiness, culture and nutrition in life. These three are the pillars of content life for humans.\\nIf you don\\'t take care of your body, where are you going to live?\\nLife offers no security. The idea of security and certainty are a function of education and economic power. While both are important, neither can bring you Happiness. You are happy only when you are doing what you love doing. And that means you must be willing to go where Life is taking you. Uncertainty, adventure, journeying into the unknownâ\\x80¦all these are an integral part of the process of Life!\\nYou may not be happy with what you have. But if all of it is taken away from you and then given back, you will become happy with it. You become happy with what you freshly get, not with what you already have.\\nthere are miracles in me\\nJust as being human is crucial to living responsibly, so is staying true, being authentic, key to living intelligently, to living happily. You are unhappy the moment you stop being true or being authentic.\\nIn this life, she clearly had no taste. But since when did taste have anything to do with happiness.\\nAmusement under late capitalism is the prolongation of work. It is sought after as an escape from the mechanised work process, and to recruit strength in order to be able to cope with it again. But at the same time mechanisation has such power over a manâ\\x80\\x99s leisure and happiness, and so profoundly determines the manufacture of amusement goods, that his experiences are inevitably after-images of the work process itself. The ostensible content is merely a faded foreground; what sinks in is the automatic succession of standardised operations. What happens at work, in the factory, or in the office can only be escaped from by approximation to it in oneâ\\x80\\x99s leisure time.\\nA broken cloud of small birds can\\'t make up its mind which tree to land in. First they fly to one, then the other, then back again. Like me, they are vagrant, having no focus. And the world is new again, and I feel clean and happy that nearly every morning for the last sixty-odd years I have popped into the world for a while and at the end of the day popped out again, and eventually the day will come when my song will end and that is all fine. I don\\'t need to do anything, I don\\'t need to be Sisyphus rolling his stone. I can be happy, just watching and listening and tasting the air without thinking, without doing. My beard is white, through sun or years; my head as smooth as a river stone. My autumn has come and I\\'m ripening - how sweet that is! How sweet a flower I\\'ll try to be.\\nDear Lord,\\nBe friendly, that\\'s all you need for happiness.\\nWhat candles are to cake; joy is to happiness.\\nEverything eventually works out â\\x80\\x93 in its own time, at its own pace, in its own way.\\nNo love story has a happy ending. The only happy ending is to be happy now.\\nHappiness--is that what this is? The word doesn\\'t feel strong enough. I forget, so often, that the most powerful moments in my life rarely end up being about my kingdom, or a war, or about even my subjects. I forget that the world can narrow down to two people, a moment of vulnerability and trust. To a moment of love that seems to outshine the rest.\\nI forget that the world can narrow down to two people, a moment of vulnerability and trust. To a moment of love that seems to outshine the rest.\\nI have a bad habit of hugging people when I am very happy, so every one who does not wish to be embraced had better keep away.\\nMy idea of happiness is a rainy evening with a comfortable book to read.\\nLit up the lamps of joy; let there be smiles.\\nWe\\'re happier when we see people for who they are, and not who we wish they were.\\nPlay your Life back from your imaginary deathbed. Think of a situation in the future when you know you are dyingâ\\x80¦and ask yourself what will you have still wanted to do if you had more time. Go do that thing right now. Do not postpone your Happiness! There is no tomorrow. You donâ\\x80\\x99t get a second shot at living Life. This is it!\\nOur family is a place where we can have a profound impact on other people. Try to make that impact as positive, life-enhancing, and encouraging as possible.\\nMay you never despair and always err on the side of happiness.\\nIf youâ\\x80\\x99re unhappy or depressed, it might be because you\\'re hanging around the wrong people.

Perhaps the secret was to make the best of what you had.\\nHappiness is an inside job.\\nIn most cases it is not happiness, but the things that are burning and destroying people from inside that are the cause of art creation.\\nThe miracle of each day. It never ceases to surprise and amaze.\\nThe Golden Sonnet\\nEvery once in a while, sit down and make a list of people who have touched your Life and made a difference to you. Quietly, thank themâ\\x80¦deeplyâ\\x80¦from the bottom of your heart. Watch yourself breaking down and crying like a baby. This is the surest way to humble yourself. And to realize just how much you owe the Universe in return for who you are, what you are and where you are today!\\nIt\\'s the birthday of our happiness,\" said Anne softly.\\nAnne laughed -- then shivered.\\nAll assume that the purpose of life is happiness - it\\'s not - happiness is only a byproduct of service.\\nLift Others (The Sonnet)\\nYour coming here...made me so very happy. I wanted to keep dancing with you forever. That we should be so sad now...means we are very dear to each other.\\nLearn to pray for your detractors. Forgive them for what they have done to you and wish them good health and peace. It is very easy to love someone you like. But it is very difficult to love someone you don\\'t agree with or relate to, or even, at times, hate. Praying for such people teaches you to dissolve hatred and embrace love. Important, you heal through this process. Try doing that. And see how happy and peaceful you begin to feel.\\nThe path of Yoga gives us the realisation that happiness is nowhere in outside world. Real Happiness is within.\\nLasting happiness cannot be found in pursuit of any goal or achievement. It does not reside in fortune or fame. It resides only in the human mind and heart, and it is here that we hope you will find it.\\nIf we know that we are deeply and completely loved by Life then we will know how to let it flow through us freely. If we know that the essential force of Life is immensely beautiful and endlessly creative then we will know how to follow our inner guidance. If we know that our true being is spiritually perfect, complete, and pure then we will be healthy, well-balanced, productive, and happy.\\nHumanity and failure are synonymous with one another â\\x80\\x93 the human race has a destiny to fail, because we have a destiny to grow.\\nWe may become so entangled in our web of pressures and expectations that we may forget the role we play in dictating how we feel on any given day.\\nWe must be aware of the amount of time invested in idle activities, as such endeavors do not serve to provide any path toward self-improvement.\\nObstacles are presented to us as an opportunity for growth.\\nWe may try to convince ourselves that we could never possibly make a valuable contribution to humanity, whether it be through invention or sharing of thoughts.

If you are constantly hungering for the next big thing, you will miss happiness and self-fulfillment along the way.\\nThere is an immense gravitation toward flaunting luxuries for purpose of gaining fame and acknowledgement. Do not get caught in the rat race of social competition.\\nWe must never wish away the days of progress that carry us to the culmination of our goals. Life exists in the journey, not the destination.\\nActing recklessly without regard for the results of our actions is no way to live.\\nA sense of progression is of utmost importance.\\nIf you are not satisfied with you life, you hold a personal responsibility to consciously change circumstances for the better - wherever possible.\\nDo we stop to think how what we are doing in this very moment might affect the state of our lives next month, next year, or even ten years from now?\\nThe path toward our goals is often a winding road; the conditions under which we set out to fulfill our dreams are prone to change.\\nKeep an open mind, and you will land where you are meant to be.\\nIt is far too easy to become complacent with avoidance of failure, that we deprive ourselves of valuable growth channels.\\nNo matter the direction in which life takes us, we mustnâ\\x80\\x99t mourn the past.\\nYou do not need to expend much effort to find something in your life that is of immense value, yet you unwittingly take for granted each and every day.\\nStagnation and complacency spell doom for any semblance of personal progress.\\nAchieving a sense of balance calls for acknowledgement of the past, focus on the present, and hope for the future.\\nIn following our dreams, we are committing our present time and resources to fulfill a future vision.\\nIt is immensely important for us to uphold and refine our goals and dreams.\\nOne of the most simplistic paths toward perpetual growth and development is to cyclically present oneself with new information.\\nThe mind is a complex operating system that intermingles action with dependencies on incentives and desires.\\nThe only constant in this world is change.\\nThe treasures of nature very often go unnoticed simply due to the sheer amount of distraction we have on a day to day basis.\\nShun the inner voice that tells you not to experience new things.\\nBe relentless in the pursuit of your dreams and aspirations.\\nAlways ensure you are seeking sustenance, both physically and psychologically.\\nWe are indebted to ourselves to always remain hungry for new knowledge.\\nWe must come to understand the temporality of all things in this world.\\nYou must know that you do not need to take the journey toward recovery alone.\\nWe must have the courage to overcome our own personal pitfalls.\\nWe must never forget that nature is an immensely powerful tool to calm our minds and bring us a sense of inner peace.\\nTake a moment to ponder the question â\\x80\\x93 what does it mean to be human?\\nIf you feel down or depressed, dedicate the much-needed time toward exploring root cause and finding the help needed. Do not deny yourself help.\\nWe will always find ourselves subject to external pressures prompting us to extend ourselves as far as our means will allow.\\nThe journey of life imbues within in us a perpetual opportunity for growth; we can readily witness the fruits of our labor on a day to day basis.\\nIn a world that can often present itself as ruthless and unforgiving, we must operate as our own support network at times.\\nWe are one with nature; all fruits of our existence are derived through the environment.\\nIf we genuinely want to do something or we reframe the perspective from which something is viewed, then the amount of willpower expended drops astronomically.\\nTreat yourself with kindness, and never forget that physical and psychological development take time.\\nDuring our younger years, the world presented us with many questions and not nearly enough answers.\\nVirtually anyone with Internet access has the capability to research nearly any topic of choice!\\nWe are taught to live by the motto of â\\x80\\x98forgive and forgetâ\\x80\\x99. But is it something you truly practice?\\nThere is so much of life to be lived, but we lose sight of our own thoughts and experiences if we mindlessly wander through the day without thinking conscious thoughts.\\nWe must clearly note that the past does not control us; rather, the past merely influences us.\\nWe live in a society that is hyper-focused on avoiding failure at all costs.\\nSteadily building commitment to healthy habits is the first step in ensuring success.\\nGrowth and failure go hand and hand; optimal levels of growth will never be as effective if you do not allow mistakes from time to time.\\nWe must actively consider our thoughts and feelings in the present moment to ensure we are guiding ourselves based upon our most up-to-date intuitions.\\nWeâ\\x80\\x99re pressured into running out and picking up the latest shiny toy, or item to impress our friends. Don\\'t buy into the latest trends.\\nDo we provide our dreams and aspirations the attention they deserve?\\nAre you inclined to offer yourself forgiveness in times of error, or kick yourself while you are down?\\nWith each passing day, are you investing time toward cultivating a library of cherished memories?\\nAt first I didnâ\\x80\\x99t like you very much but now that I know you, you are my friend.\\nObserving daily silence periods requires the diligent following of a process. It is not about attaining a state of thoughtlessness. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s not possible. And thatâ\\x80\\x99s not required either. What is possible, and important, is that you can still the mind and train it to attend only to the present. And like with everything else in Life, mastering this process requires disciplined application and rigorous practice. It is only through stilling the mind, through being in the now, that you learn the art of being happy despite the circumstances.\\nTrue happiness is neither the fulfillment of passion nor pleasure but peace of being.\\nHappiness is personal joy of pursuit.\\n\\n'"
